	<div class="body taskbody">

			<p class="p">You have logged on to the gamification workbench with the role
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">TenantOperator</span> or
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">AppAdmin</span>, and you have opened the
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Rule Engine</span> tab of the releated app.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="section context"><div class="tasklabel"><h2 class="sectiontitle tasklabel">Context</h2></div>
			<p class="p">The <span class="ph pname">gamification service</span>
				creates a rule engine instance for each app. Over time the state of each rule engine
				instance changes based on its usage. A recovery mechanism for different rule engine
				states has been introduced to allow a clean recovery in case of errors, rule set
				changes or system migrations. This mechanism allows to create and restore snapshots
				of the current rule engine instance session and its deployed rule set. Snapshots are
				stored into the database.</p>

			<p class="p">Generation of snapshots</p>

			<p class="p">Using “apply changes” (see <a class="xref" href="4e39a6549a1e46b180c871875d075738.html">Updating Rules</a> for
				details), the current rule set stored in the database is deployed on the currently
				running rule engine instance. Technically, the current session, which includes all
				facts and events, is upgraded to a new rule set. To assure compatibility of new
				rules with the existing session, rules are being evaluated one by one. Compatible
				pairs of session and rule set are stored as snapshots. </p>

			<p class="p">Additionally, when receiving events via the “handleEvent” method, the session will
				change as well and requires the same recovery mechanism. The <span class="ph pname">gamification service</span>
				service will generate snapshots during event execution in dynamic intervals.</p>

			<div class="p">The <span class="ph pname">gamification service</span>
				manages rules and corresponding snapshots in the following way:<ul class="ul" id="loio8fc0c26969924e0681bb2ca14ca1d9cd__ul_agw_tmt_vw">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">After each successful rule deployment (<span class="ph uicontrol">Apply Changes</span>) the
							corresponding rule set as well as the session are both tagged with a new
							version. The service stores the latest 10 versions at max. </p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">For the latest (currently active) version as well as the previous version the <span class="ph pname">gamification service</span> stores the 10 latest snapshots in slots numbered 1 through 10.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">By using the API and the Workbench you can retrieve all available snapshots as well as the
							corresponding rule set. Additionally, the rule engine can be restored to
							any of these snapshots.</p>

					</li>

				</ul>
</div>
