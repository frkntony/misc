<p class="p">You can start to develop your application in any browser, but you should double-check on a
			regular basis whether your development also works with other browsers. For most
			browsers, press <kbd class="ph userinput">F12</kbd> on your keyboard to launch the development
			tools, or call them up from the browser menu. The following list gives you details about
			the various common browsers:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio615d9e4aaa34447fbd4aa5f19dfde9b8__ul_srw_3sf_gl"><li class="li">Chrome provides excellent built-in debugging capabilities.</li>
<li class="li">Firefox provides built-in developer tools, but we recommend that you install the Firebug
				extension which offers more functionality.</li>
<li class="li">Internet Explorer provides built-in developer tools, however these tools are lacking
				functionality or make some steps a little more complicated than necessary. For
				example, there is an extra button in the developer tools that you need to hit
				explicitly to start debugging, whereas in other browsers you just have to open the
				tools. Visual Studio provides a description of how to use Visual Studio for
				debugging applications for Internet Explorer under the title <em class="ph i">Debug Web Apps with
					Visual Studio</em>.</li>
<li class="li">Safari provides a native set of developer tools. For remote debugging on mobile
				devices, see [Link].</li>
