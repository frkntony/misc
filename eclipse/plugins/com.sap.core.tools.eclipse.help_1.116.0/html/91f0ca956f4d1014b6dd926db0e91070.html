<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Data binding is used to bind two data sources or information sources together and to
		keep them in synch. Model instances hold the data and provide the methods required to set
		the data or to retrieve data from a server.</p>
<p class="p"> If data binding is implemented and defined properly, all changes in one data source are
			automatically reflected in the other data source. Usually, the UI uses data binding to
			bind UI controls to a data source that holds the application data, so that the controls
			are updated automatically whenever application data is changed. The model provides the
			method for creating bindings to the data. When this method is called, a <dfn class="term">data
				binding</dfn> instance is created, which contains the binding information and
			provides an event, which is fired whenever the bound data is changed. An element can
			listen to this event and update its visualization according to the new data. </p>
<p class="p">The term <dfn class="term">data binding</dfn> is also used when changes in the control cause updates in
			the underlying application data, such as data being entered by a user. This is called
				<dfn class="term">bi-directional binding</dfn> or <dfn class="term">two-way binding</dfn>. </p>
<p class="p">A Web application should support several data sources, such as JSON, XML, Atom, or OData.
			However, the way in which data binding is defined and implemented within the UI controls
			should be independent of the respective data source. It should also be possible to
			create a custom model implementation for data sources that are not yet covered by the
			framework or are domain-specific. </p>
