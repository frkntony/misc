					<li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Other Loggers</span> adjusts the log level for all other

					<p class="p">Use payload and CPIC tracing on Level 3 carefully and only when requested to
						do so for support reasons. In particular, the trace may write sensitive
						information (such as payload data of HTTP/RFC requests and responses) to the
						trace files, and thus, present a potential security risk. For this reason
						the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>
						(effective version <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">2.2</span>) supports an implementation of a
						"four-eyes principle" for activating the trace levels that dump the network
						traffic into a trace file. When this four-eyes principle is in place, two
						users are required for the activation of a trace level that would record
						traffic data. </p>

					<p class="p">For more information about setting this extra security measure, see <a class="xref" href="4c8f678d84b94dfe9af539d040259837.html">Securing the Activation of Traffic Traces</a>.</p>
