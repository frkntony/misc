	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The extension application back end includes existing SAP solution services, or it can
		expose custom services delivered with the extension application on <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>.
		Usually, the back end is decoupled from the front end by OData, REST, or JSON
		services.</p>

		<div class="p">The extension application back end comprises the following artifacts:<ul class="ul" id="loiobf3958c9eba64b2caf1525806d76d863__ul_lcg_yz4_3r">
				<li class="li">

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Business logic</div><div type="Business logic">
			
			<p class="p">The clearly decoupled business logic makes it easier to develop, test and operate
				extension applications on <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>. It also enables the
				implementation of concepts such as zero-downtime updates, A/B testing for UI, and
				other. It ensures that all security checks are performed on the right level, leaving
				no space for error of putting business logic in the UI tier. Extension applications
				can leverage any available <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> runtime. However, the level of
				integration of the different runtimes may vary. The list of features whose support
				may vary depending on the runtime includes but is not limited to automatic
				application provisioning, roles and identity propagation, auto-discovery of
				different application-bundled artifacts.</p>

			<p class="p">Extension applications benefit from the security model provided by both <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> and the extended SAP solution. The security frame comprises automatic
				roles and permissions import, usage of SAP solution-native admin tools, transparency
				on roles permission assignment, consistent administration experience.</p>

			<p class="p">By leveraging all the available platform services, extension applications will benefit from
				the account-levelhave Single Sign-On with the extended solution. For some of the SAP
				solutions (for example, <span class="ph pname">SAP SuccessFactors</span>), it is possible to
				turn on native management of permissions and roles using the solution-native
				administration tools. This is implemented by changing the default <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> role
				provider. Essentially, extension applications use the available runtime-specific
				standard mechanisms to check for role assignment and <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> transparently
				performs the assignment check in the underlying extended SAP solution.</p>

			<p class="p"> In the scenario where the extended solution does not come with an embedded identity provider
				(IdP), we use the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication
                                service</span> as a central
				point for managing trust and user authentication. By using the IdP-proxy feature of
					<span class="ph pname">Identity Authentication</span>, you
				can define your own identity provider.</p>

				back end: </p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Persistency</div><div type="Persistency">
			
			<p class="p">The persistency layer is an essential aspect that needs to be considered when
				developing an extension application. There are several options for storing data
				offered by <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>, including both relational (for example, SAP HANA
				and Sybase ASE as offered by persistence service) and unstructured (document
				service) data storage options. Thus, the various storage needs of the extension
				applications can be covered.</p>

			<p class="p">It is also possible to store data in the extended SAP solution in the form of custom
				field or custom business objects. This option varies for the different extended
				solutions. Custom business objects, however, are usually limited both in volume and
				in number.</p>

			<p class="p">The following graphic provides an overview of the persistency options for the
				extension applications:</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Connectivity</div><div type="Connectivity">
			
			<p class="p">One of the most critical layers for the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> extension concept is
				the connectivity layer. It connects an extension application to the extended SAP
				solution and to other required backend systems. The connectivity is accomplished
				through a set of standardized destinations. All back-end calls are performed on
				behalf of the user who is logged on to the extension front-end layer. To implement
				that, <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> leverages SAML 2.0 bearer assertion authentication
				flow. The standardized destination names allow the portability of partner
				applications - partner extension applications can expect to be installed in an
				environment where the required destinations are in place and can be used. For more
				information about the standardized destinations, see solution-specific section.</p>

			<p class="p">It is also possible to have destinations configured to use basic authentication or
				other authentication means. However, we do not recommend the use of service users or
				a hard-coded user for back-end calls because the back-end systems will not be able
				to perform user-based authorization checks. Furthermore, using service users makes
				the end-to-end traceability very hard to achieve.</p>

			<p class="p">The following graphic provides an overview of the connectivity layer. </p>

			<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> 
				<p class="p">Extension applications work with your critical business data. Therefore, you must use only
					applications that come from a trusted application provider. Always make sure
					that the extension application complies with the common security best practices
					and fulfills data confidentiality and data protection requirements defined for
					your organization. Do not deploy or allow access of untrusted applications to
					your mission-critical back-end systems. </p>
