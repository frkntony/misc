			<p class="p">The <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> provides
				the possibility to trace all network traffic going through it (HTTP/RFC requests and
				responses) for support purposes. This traffic data may contain business critical
				information or security sensitive data, such as usernames, passwords, address data,
				credit card numbers, and so on. Thus, by activating the corresponding trace level, a
					<span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>
				administrator could see business data that he/she is not supposed to see. If you
				want to prevent this behavior from occurring, you need to implement the following
				four-eyes principle. This principle is supported by the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> release
					<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">1.3.2</span> and higher.</p>

			<p class="p">Once the four-eyes principle is applied, activating a trace level that dumps traffic
				data will require two separate users:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio4c8f678d84b94dfe9af539d040259837__ul_fbj_bgk_vm">
				<li class="li">An operating system user on the machine where the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> is
					installed;</li>

				<li class="li">An <span class="ph uicontrol">Administrator</span> user of the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>
					user interface.</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">By assigning these two users to two different persons, it can be ensured that both
				persons are needed to activate a traffic dump (that is, when a certain problem needs
				to be troubleshot) but neither of them can do this on their own.</p>
