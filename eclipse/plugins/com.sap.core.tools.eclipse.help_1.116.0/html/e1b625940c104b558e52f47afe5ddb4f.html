<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">A model in the Model View Controller concept holds the data and provides methods to
		retrieve the data from the database and to set and update data.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> provides the following predefined models: </p>
<ul class="ul" id="loioe1b625940c104b558e52f47afe5ddb4f__ul_isr_ltw_qk"><li class="li">The <dfn class="term">JSON model</dfn> can be used to bind controls to JavaScript object data,
				which is usually serialized in the JSON format. The JSON model is a client-side
				model and, therefore, intended for small datasets, which are completely available on
				the client. The JSON model supports two-way binding.</li>
<li class="li">The <dfn class="term">XML model</dfn> is a client-side model intended for small datasets, which are
				completely available on the client. The XMLModel does not contain mechanisms for
				server-based paging or loading of deltas </li>
<li class="li">The <dfn class="term">Resource model </dfn>is designed to handle data in resource bundles,
				mainly to provide texts in different languages.</li>
<li class="li">The <dfn class="term">OData model</dfn> enables binding of controls to data from OData
				services. The OData model is a server-side model: the dataset is only available on
				the server and the client only knows the currently visible rows and fields. This
				also means that sorting and filtering on the client is <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span>
				possible. For this, the client has to send a request to the server. The OData model
				currently supports OData version 2.0. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p">The JSON model, XML model, and the resource model are client-side models, meaning that
			the model data is loaded completely and is available on the client. Operations such as
			sorting and filtering are executed on the client without further server requests. The
			OData model is a server-side model and only loads the data requested by the user
			interface from the server. Any changes in data binding or list operations require a new
			request to the server. </p>
<p class="p">You can not only define one model for your applications, but define different areas in
			your application with different models and assign single controls to a model. You can
			also define nested models, for example, a JSON model defined for the application and an
			OData model for a table control contained in the application. </p>
<p class="p">A web application should support several data sources, such as JSON, XML, Atom, or OData.
			However, the way in which data binding is defined and implemented within the UI controls
			should be independent of the respective data source. It is also possible to create a
			custom model implementation for data sources that are not yet covered by the framework
			or are domain-specific. </p>
