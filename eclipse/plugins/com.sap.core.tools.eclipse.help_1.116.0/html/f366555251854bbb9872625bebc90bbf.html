				IT landscape, you can come across a scenario where various systems interact and
				communicate with each other directly, at optimum efficiency. However, as you know,
				an IT landscape is never static. With time, more systems based on different
				technologies get added and as a result the complexity of the interactions also
				increases. Managing this complex web of applications and systems require time,
				money, and resources and, in the mid-term, it's not efficient or scalable without
				the introduction of a messaging architecture.</p>
<p class="p">The following diagram
				illustrates peer-to-peer integration without messaging middleware.</p>

                                    Messaging</span> simplifies connectivity. SAPâ€™s messaging-as-a-service solution in the Cloud
				enables you to connect the applications in your landscape through
					<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">messaging hosts</span>. A messaging host acts as an intermediary
				message broker and is responsible for sending and receiving messages between your
				applications. It effectively decouples communication between senders and receivers
				and is responsible for ensuring that messages are sent to all intended receivers. If
				receiving applications are temporarily offline, the messaging host buffers the
				message until it can be sent to the receiver successfully.</p>
<p class="p">The following
				diagram illustrates this messaging-oriented architecture with a central messaging
				host.</p>

				two applications. An application sends a message to a specific queue in a messaging
				host. The intended receiver, in this setup, is subscribed to that same queue and can
				read any messages from it as soon as they have been published by the
			sender.</p>
