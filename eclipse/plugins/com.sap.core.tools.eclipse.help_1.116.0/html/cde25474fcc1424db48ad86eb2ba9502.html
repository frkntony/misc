	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Before configuring <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> custom domains, you need to make some
		preliminary steps and fulfil a number of prerequisites.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">1. Buy a custom domain quota</div><div type="1. Buy a custom domain quota">
			
			<p class="p">You need to have a quota for domains configured for your account. One domain corresponds to
				one SSL host that you can use. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="a71a081b39e343e097046bf487f57af3.html" title="A customer account allows you to host productive, business-critical applications with 24x7 support.">Purchasing a Customer Account</a>.</p>

			<div class="p">The following two steps involve external service providers - domain name registrar
				and certificate authority.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> The domain name and the server certificate for this
					domain are issued by external authorities and owned by the customer. </div>
</div>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">2. Choose and buy the domain names to be used by your applications</div><div type="2. Choose and buy the domain names to be used by your applications">
			
			<p class="p">You need to come up with a list of custom domains and applications that you want to be served
				through them. For example, you may decide to have three custom domains:
					<kbd class="ph userinput">test.myshop.com</kbd>,
					<kbd class="ph userinput">preview.myshop.com</kbd>, <kbd class="ph userinput">www.myshop.com</kbd>
				- for test, preview and productive versions of your <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>
				application.</p>

			<p class="p">The domain names are owned by the customer, not by <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>. Therefore, you
				will need to buy the custom domain names that you have chosen from a registrar
				selling domain names.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">3. Choose a CA to issue the certificate for your domain</div><div type="3. Choose a CA to issue the certificate for your domain"><p class="p">To ensure your
				domain is trusted and all your application data is protected, you have to get an
				appropriate SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA). To sign and issue
				this certificate, you need a certificate signing request (CSR), which you will
				create in the following procedure. Note that we do not support uploading of existing
				certificates that are not generated using our <span class="keyword cmdname">generate-csr</span>
				command.</p>
<p class="p">Before buying a certificate from a provider, you need to decide on
				the number and type of domains you want to be protected by this certificate. One
				certificate can be valid for a number of domains.</p>
<div class="p">There are various types of
				domains, the basic ones being: <ul class="ul" id="loiocde25474fcc1424db48ad86eb2ba9502__ul_qzz_whd_4n">
					<li class="li">Single domain - protects one domain (for example,
							<kbd class="ph userinput">www.myshop.com</kbd>)</li>

					<li class="li">Single domain with unlimited subdomains (wildcard) - secures a domain with
						unlimited subdomains (for example, <kbd class="ph userinput">*.myshop.com</kbd> -
						this covers any subdomains of <kbd class="ph userinput">myshop.com</kbd> - for
						example, <kbd class="ph userinput">test.myshop.com</kbd>;
							<kbd class="ph userinput">preview.myshop.com</kbd>,
							<kbd class="ph userinput">www.myshop.com</kbd>, etc.). <div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> Choosing the wildcard subdomain certificate ensures protection of all
							subdomains in your custom domain (<kbd class="ph userinput">*.myshop.com</kbd>),
							but not the domain itself (<kbd class="ph userinput">myshop.com</kbd> cannot be
							used).</div>
</li>

					<li class="li">Multiple domain - secures multiple domain names with a single certificate.
						This type allows you to use any number of different domain names or common
						names. For example, one certificate can support:
							<kbd class="ph userinput">www.myshop.com</kbd>,
							<kbd class="ph userinput">*.test.myshop.com</kbd>,
							<kbd class="ph userinput">*.myshop.eu</kbd>,
						<kbd class="ph userinput">www.myshop.de</kbd>.</li>

				</ul>
</div>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> Choose as specific domain names as possible. Also, host all domains
				in the certificate in one single place (<span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>).</div>
<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> The CSR is valid only for the landscape host on which it was
				generated and cannot be moved and downloaded. The host represents a regional data
				center: <span class="ph uicontrol">hana.ondemand.com</span> for Europe;
					<span class="ph uicontrol">us1.hana.ondemand.com</span> for the United States;
					<span class="ph uicontrol">ap1.hana.ondemand.com</span> for Asia-Pacific.</div>
The
			certificate has to be in Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail (PEM) format (128 or 256 bits)
			with private key (2048-4096 bits).</div></div>
