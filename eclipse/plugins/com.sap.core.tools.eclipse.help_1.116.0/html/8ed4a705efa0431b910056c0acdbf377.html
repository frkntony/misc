	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">An account is a hosted environment on <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> in which users deploy
		applications and connect them to services. </p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Accounts</div><div type="Accounts">
			
			<p class="p">An account on <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> represents the scope of the functionality you
				have purchased based on your contract with SAP and the agreed level of support you are entitled to. It is the logical representation
				of your <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> landscape. In a productive environment, the account
				model has a higher degree of complexity than in a trial environment. It may consist of more than one account, each representing a
				different instance in your landscape, for example.</p>

			<p class="p">There are also differences in how accounts work depending on the account type you choose. The account type determines pricing,
				conditions of use, resources, services available, and landscape host. It depends on your use case if you choose a free trial account
				(for testing) or a licensed account on a productive landscape.</p>

			<p class="p">You can start by getting a free <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> developer license that is for
				trial use only. This also gives you access to our community and all the free technical resources, tutorials, blogs, support you need.
				For productive use, please buy a paid customer or a partner account. It is important that you are aware of these differences to enable
				you to plan and set up your landscape and account model in the best possible way. For this, please answer a couple of questions, for
				example:</p>

			<div class="p">
				<ul class="ul" id="loio8ed4a705efa0431b910056c0acdbf377__ul_y12_trt_qy">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Do you only want to try something out in a trial environment?</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Is your account meant for running your productive business?</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">How many accounts do you need?</p>

					</li>

				</ul>

			</div>

			<p class="p">In the cockpit, accounts are organized in a hierarchical structure and are associated with a particular data center. To run and manage
				your applications on <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> and to connect them to services, your
				user must be assigned to an account. Your user can be assigned to one or more accounts. You can view a list of all accounts available
				to you and access them using the cockpit. A user with administrative permissions can use a self-service to create accounts, add users
				to accounts, and assign roles to users for the account in question.</p>

			<p class="p">Depending on your needs, different account types are available for testing (free) or productive use (paid accounts). The account type
				determines pricing, conditions of use, resources, services available, and landscape host. You can start by getting a free <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> developer license that is for trial use only. This also gives
				you access to our community and all the free technical resources, tutorials, blogs, support you need. For productive use, you need to
				purchase a paid customer or a partner account.</p>

			<p class="p">For more information, see <a class="xref" href="e4986153bb571014a2ddc2fdd682ee90.html" title="This section provides an overview of account types available on SAP Cloud Platform.">Account Types</a>.</p>

			<p class="p">Each account is associated with a particular data center, which is the physical location (for example, Europe, US East) where
				applications, data, or services are hosted.</p>

			<p class="p">While developer accounts use the trial landscape, which is located in Europe only, customer and partner accounts use a productive
				landscape, which is available on a regional basis.</p>

			<p class="p">The specific landscape associated with an account is relevant when you deploy applications (landscape host) and access the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> cockpit (cockpit URL).</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> You can have several accounts in one or more landscapes. Your accounts are independent of each other, even if you have accounts of
				the same name in different regions. The data center assigned to your account is not directly related to your location. You could be
				located in the United States, for example, but operate your account in Europe.</div>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Global Accounts</div><div type="Global Accounts">
			
			<p class="p">Each customer or partner account is associated with a particular global account. The global account groups together different accounts
				that an administrator makes available to the users in their organization for deploying applications on the cloud platform. The
				customer data, billing information, and purchased quota (such as Java quota) are stored in a global account. Accounts in a global
				account are independent from each other. This is important to consider with respect to security, user management, data migration and
				management, integration, and so on, when you plan the landscape and overall architecture.</p>

			<p class="p">Administrators can assign the available quota to the different accounts and move it between accounts that belong to the same global
				account (Prerequisite: You have the Administrator role for the relevant accounts.). New accounts are assigned automatically to the
				associated global account. The global account is the same on all landscapes.</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> The global account feature is not available in a trial environment. As a user working in a trial environment, you see your account
				in which you deploy and run applications.</div>
