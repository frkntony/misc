	<h1 class="title topictitle1">Best Practices</h1>

	
	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Use these best practices to get started with Git and to avoid common pitfalls.</p>

		<p class="p">If you are new to Git, we strongly recommend reading a text book about Git, search the Internet for documentation and guides available online, or
			get in touch with the large worldwide community of developers working with Git.</p>

		<div class="p">
			<ul class="ul" id="loio7032e96e47954e068c2f3714ed1884c8__ul_jvm_l1r_g5">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Perform a fetch or pull command before creating a new branch.</p>

					<p class="p">In general, base your work on the most recent changes of your co-workers. Otherwise, you might have to resolve conflicts before the changes
						can be pushed.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Create a new local branch for every new feature or bug-fix you want to start.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Derive new local branches from <span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">origin/master</span></p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Write meaningful commit messages.</p>

					<p class="p">A commit message should describe <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">why</span> you are doing a particular change rather than describing <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">what</span>
						you did. The <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">why</span> helps your co-workers to understand the intention and consequences of your change. The
							<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">what</span> on the other side can easily be deduced from the source code, that is, from the difference
						between the old and new version.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Commit early and often.</p>

					<p class="p">While developing larger features, create periodic checkpoints in form of commits, for example when you are experimenting with different
						possible solutions. If you did something wrong, you can easily go back to the last known good commit and start over. Before
						pushing the feature, squeeze the checkpoints into one final commit.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Create small, easy to digest commits.</p>

					<p class="p">A commit that touches thousands of lines of code is likely to be much more difficult to understand and integrate than a commit that changes
						only a tiny piece of code. For example, it is usually considered bad practice to refactor your code and implement a new
						feature in one and the same commit.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Avoid pushing patches that break your code.</p>

					<p class="p">Git supports amendments to commits that have not yet been pushed to the Git service. This means you can  correct and improve your changes
						incrementally before pushing them.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Never rewrite a commit that has already been pushed to the Git service.</p>

					<div class="p">Your co-workers might already have fetched that commit to their local repositories and based their work on it. Instead push a new commit.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
							<p class="p">The only valid exception to this rule is if you accidentally pushed a secret, for example a password, to the Git service.</p>

						</div>
</div>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Avoid dependencies on changes that have not been pushed yet.</p>

					<p class="p">While Git provides some powerful mechanisms for handling chains of commits, for example interactive rebasing, these are usually considered to
						be for experienced users only.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li"><p class="p">Do not push binary files.</p>
Git is very efficient in calculating differences in text files, but not in binary files. Pushing binary files
					bloats your repository size and affects performance, for example in clone operations.</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Store source code, not generated files and build artifacts.</p>

					<p class="p">Keep build artifacts in a separate artifact repository because they tend to change frequently and bloat your commit history. Furthermore,
						build artifacts  are usually stored in some sort of binary or archive format that Git cannot handle efficiently.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Run garbage collection periodically.</p>

					<p class="p">Trigger a garbage collection in the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> cockpit from time to time to
						compact and clean up your repository. Also run garbage collection regularly for repositories cloned to your workplace. This
						will minimize the disk usage and improve the performance of common Git commands.</p>

				</li>
