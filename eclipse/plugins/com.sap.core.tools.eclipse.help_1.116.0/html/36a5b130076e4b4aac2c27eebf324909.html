<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Fragments are light-weight UI parts (UI sub-trees) which can be reused, defined similar
		to views, but do not have any controller or other behavior code involved.</p>
<p class="p">UI parts which are to be used in several views cannot be easily defined. They either have to be
			created as new controls, or they have to be created as views. Creating them as new
			controls results in a development overhead, while creating them as separate views
			results in a runtime overhead. In the latter case they would have a separate controller
			instead of having the same controller as the view does. Also, views and popup controls
			like dialogs do not go well together. The dialog content can be defined as a view but
			the dialog control itself always has to be written in the program.</p>
<p class="p">To solve these issues, fragments have been introduced. They can be reused and, if source code
			is required and for event handler methods, they can connect to existing controllers of
			the "owning" view. This means that one important characteristic of fragments is that
			they are independent of the MVC concept and can be used without using MVC. However, if
			fragments are used together with views and controllers, fragments can make use of them
			and integrate them neatly.</p>
<p class="p">Similar to <samp class="ph codeph">DocumentFragments</samp> in HTML, the fragment itself has no HTML
			representation when it is inserted into the UI tree. Instead, its content is inserted.
			This means that fragments are not like controls, but more like a factory creating the
			contained controls. They support reuse and view modularization without adding
			overhead.</p>
<p class="p">Because of the huge similarities of fragments and the definition and usage of MVC views, it is
			important to be familiar with the <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> MVC concept. Many topics, such as the fragment
			content definition, are identical.</p>
<p class="p">To support different use cases and because some developers prefer declarative UIs while others
			prefer to programmatically construct them, <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> provides different types of
			fragments:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio36a5b130076e4b4aac2c27eebf324909__ul_zgg_rgv_3m"><li class="li">XML fragments</li>
<li class="li">HTML fragments</li>
<li class="li">JS fragments</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">More fragment types can be implemented and plugged in.</p>
<p class="p">Defining a fragment is similar to defining views within a separate file. The fragments
			simply end with <span class="ph filepath">*.fragment</span> instead of <span class="ph filepath">*.view</span>.
			Also, the same rules for file location apply.</p>
