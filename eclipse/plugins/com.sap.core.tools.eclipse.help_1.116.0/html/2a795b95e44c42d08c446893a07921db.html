		<div class="section">
			<p class="p">A database tunnel allows you to use database tools, such as the SAP HANA studio or
				Eclipse Data Tools Platform, to connect to the remote database instance. It provides
				you with direct access to a schema and allows you to manipulate it at database
				level.</p>

			<p class="p">The SAP HANA studio provides the most convenient option for connecting to the remote
				database, since it automatically opens the database tunnel for you and closes it
				when you disconnect. It is therefore the recommended tool to use. Bear in mind that
				if you choose to use another tool you will have to explicitly open the database
				tunnel yourself. </p>

			<p class="p">To connect to the remote database using the SAP HANA studio (Eclipse with appropriate
				plugins), proceed as described in: </p>

			<p class="p">In the wizard, select the <span class="ph uicontrol">Trial instances</span> radio button and

			<p class="p">For continuous integration and test automation, you can open a database tunnel using
