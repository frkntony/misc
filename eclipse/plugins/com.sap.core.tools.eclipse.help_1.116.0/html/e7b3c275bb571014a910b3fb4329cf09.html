				restrictions, such as no access to the operating system. A shared SAP HANA database
				system, on the other hand, available on a trial basis, provides a managed
				environment in which additional restrictions apply to ensure user and data
				isolation. You can use
				the
				SAP HANA database with multitenant database container support
				enabled (beta), both in a trial and in a productive landscape. The main differences
				are outlined below: </p>

			<p class="p">When consuming the persistence service in your Java applications, be aware of the following
				restrictions: </p>
 
			<ul class="ul"><li class="li">No database abstraction <p class="p">The persistence service does not provide database abstraction for the
						supported database types (SAP HANA database and SAP ASE database).
						Applications must be aware of the type of database they use and must be
						written, if necessary, in a database-specific way. </p>

				</li>
<li class="li">No automatic life cycle management for database objects <p class="p">The persistence service does not
						provide automatic life cycle management for database objects, such as
						tables, indices, sequences, and so on. It is the responsibility of the
						application to create the necessary database objects, either by using JDBC
						to send the corresponding data definition statements to the database or by
						using the schema creation capabilities of EclipseLink. Due to limitations of
						the EclipseLink schema creation feature, changes to the schema, like
						altering a table definition, must be done by the application. Alternatively,
						open source tools for database schema management (like Liquibase) can be
						used for life cycle management for database objects, but must be bundled
						with the application. </p>
