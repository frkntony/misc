					<p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Current Metrics</span> panel shows the current state of the metrics for
						the selected database system. When a threshold is reached, the metric health
						status changes to warning or critical.</p>

					<p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Metrics History</span> panel shows the metrics history of your database.
						You can view the graphics of the different metrics and zoom in when you
						click and drag horizontally or vertically to get further details. If you
						zoom in a graphic horizontally, all other graphics zoom in to the same level
						of details too. You can press <kbd class="key">Shift</kbd> and then drag to scroll all
						graphics simultaneously to the left or right. You can zoom out to the
						initial state with a double-click.</p>

					<div class="p">You can select different time intervals for viewing the metrics. Depending on
						the selected interval, data is aggregated as follows:<ul class="ul" id="loiob02814df3acf42d3b41c18c99ad35c27__ul_sps_kxl_q5">
							<li class="li">last 12 or 24 hours - data is collected each minute </li>

							<li class="li">last 7 days - data is aggregated from the average values for 10
								minutes </li>

							<li class="li">last 30 days - data is aggregated from the average values for an
								hour </li>

						</ul>
</div>

					<p class="p">You can also select a custom time interval when you are viewing the history of metrics. Note
						that if you select an interval in which the database has not been running,
						the graphics will not contain any data.</p>
