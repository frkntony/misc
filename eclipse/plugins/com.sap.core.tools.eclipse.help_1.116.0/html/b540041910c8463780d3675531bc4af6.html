			<p class="p">Java Persistence API (JPA) offers two main types of persistence, container-managed
				persistence and application-managed persistence, which differ in terms of the
				management and life cycle of the entity manager. </p>

			<p class="p">Although JPA is suited for most application development scenarios and is the
				recommended approach on <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>, there might
				be cases where the low-level control provided by Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
				is more appropriate. </p>

			<p class="p">Database instances in the cloud are protected by a firewall, in other words, they are
				not directly accessible.Before you programm with a database, you need to connect to
				the database by opening a database tunnel, which provides a secure connection from
				your local machine and bypasses the firewall. </p>

			<p class="p">If an application uses the default data source and runs locally on Apache Derby,
				provided as standard for local development, it can be tested on the local runtime
				without any further configuration.</p>

			<p class="p">The SQL trace provides a log of selected SQL statements with details about when a
				statement was executed and its duration, allowing you to identify inefficient SQL
				statements used in your applications and investigate performance issues. SQL trace
				records are integrated in the standard trace log files written at runtime.</p>
