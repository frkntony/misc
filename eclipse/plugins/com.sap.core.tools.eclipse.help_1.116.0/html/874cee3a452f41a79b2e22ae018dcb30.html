<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The dependency resolution tool analyzes a module file and all its dependencies and
		creates a new fil containing the original module content, as well as any required
		modules.</p>
<p class="p">During development the dependencies between modules are usually resolved on the client at
			runtime. The modules can be modified in the development environment and can be deployed
			as individual entities to runtime. If caching is configured properly, only the modified
			modules are reloaded when the client is refreshed.</p>
<p class="p">In a productive system, however, bundling several modules into one single file helps to reduce
			the number of roundtrips and can help to reduce the impact of network latency. At the
			same time, the flexibility and transparency of the dependency management should not get
			lost.</p>
<p class="p">The dependency resolution tool automatically avoids double inclusion of modules. The tool can
			be used in two ways: Either via an Ant task at build time to create a merged super
			module which can then be referenced in any HTML page instead of the original file, or at
			runtime by using a servlet on server side.</p>
