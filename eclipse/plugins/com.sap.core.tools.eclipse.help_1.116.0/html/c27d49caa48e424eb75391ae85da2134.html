<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can use an XML view as a template that is transformed by an XML preprocessor on the
		source level, that is, the <samp class="ph codeph">XML DOM</samp>, before an <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> control tree is created

			<p class="p">See the example and introduction in the topic <a class="xref" href="5ee619fc1370463ea674ee04b65ed83b.html">XML Templating in SAPUI5</a>.</p>

			<p class="p">In the example, the models available to the preprocessor are initially as follows.
				Note how a model name can be seen as a variable with a value that consists of two
				pieces: a model instance and a binding context's path.</p>

			<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">meta = oMetaModel, "/dataServices/schema/0/entityType/0"</samp></p>

			<p class="p">You can base conditions on the available variables. XML attributes that represent an
				available binding are replaced automatically. The
					<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;template:with&gt;</samp> instruction can be used to change a
				variable's value or to add a variable with a new name. Likewise, the
					<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;template:repeat&gt;</samp> instruction deals with its loop variable.
				When a fragment is inlined, the current variable assignment is propagated into the
				fragment's content and so on. Preprocessing instructions are inserted in XML syntax
				and assigned to the XML namespace
					<samp class="ph codeph">http://schemas.sap.com/sapui5/extension/sap.ui.core.template/1</samp>,
				which is referred to by the namespace prefix template in the code samples.</p>
