	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> is the extension platform for SAP. It enables developers to
		develop loosely coupled extension applications securely, thus implementing additional
		workflows or modules on top of the existing SAP cloud solution they already have. </p>

		<p class="p"><span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> provides a secure application container which decouples the extension
			applications from the extended SAP solution via a public API layer. This container
			ensures that extension applications have no impact on the stability of the extended
			solutions. It also ensures that data access is governed through the same roles and
			permission checks as those of any other SAP interface. <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>
			simplifies many of the system integration challenges, handling aspects such as identity
			propagation, account onboarding, dynamic theming and branding and installation
			automation and provisioning.</p>

				<li class="li">Extensions and extended SAP cloud solutions co-located in the same data center, where
						possible<p class="p">In most of the cases the extensions that are being developed are
						co-located in the same data center as the SAP product that is being
						extended. The co-location ensures that the complete solution is using one
						infrastructure and is operated by one and the same team on this
						infrastructure. It also improves the response time for API calls.</p>
</li>

				<li class="li"> Integration with SAP Cloud product toolset<p class="p">This integration allows SAP solution
						administrators to have a consistent experience in managing extensions as an
						integral part of the product they are responsible for, including but not
						limited to software lifecycle management, administration of roles,
						permissions and visibility groups.</p>
</li>

				<li class="li">Dynamic UI branding and theming<p class="p">The tight integration between the SAP product
						and <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> allows extension users to get the same seamless
						user experience as the native product modules. It also allows the delivery
						of SAP solution-specific artifacts, such as navigation exit points, tiles,
						widgets or external business objects. </p>
</li>

				<li class="li">Security integration<p class="p">The integration between the SAP product and <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> also allows you to manage the extension you are building by
						using all the authentication and authorization capabilities of the SAP
						product you want to extend.</p>
</li>

				<li class="li">Custom development<p class="p">As a customer of an SAP cloud solution, you can create your own
						extension applications using <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>. SAP provides access to
						all the required integration and implementation materials describing how <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> is connected to the corresponding SAP cloud solution.
						Furthermore, for some of the SAP cloud solutions (for example
						SuccessFactors), <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> offers out-of-the box and
						pre-integrated extension accounts. You can leverage all the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> tools for the implementation of those extension
					applications.</p>
</li>

				<li class="li">Certified partner applications<p class="p">As a customer of an SAP cloud solution, you can also use an
						existing extension application provided by one of the SAP certified
						partners. Depending on the extension, it can be provided free of charge or
						for a certain fee. </p>
<p class="p">This option does not require own development.
						Depending on the delivery model of the partner extension, you may require
						<span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> resources for running the extension in your <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> account or alternatively, you can consume the extension as a
						service for a monthly fee.</p>
</li>

				<li class="li">Extension customization<p class="p">You can also have a mixed scenario where you first obtain and then
						further customize a partner extension application to best meet your
						needs.</p>

			<div class="p"><span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> serves as a dedicated and isolated secure application container
				(hosting Java or HTML5 applications, or both). On one hand, it provides the
				API-level access to the extended SAP solution. On the other hand, it takes care of
				the lifecycle management and the initial configuration of the extension
				applications. There are several levels of extension integration:<ul class="ul" id="loio08b1effc53634890a525f945017e2edc__ul_unr_5xz_fs">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Application customization</p>

						<p class="p">Usually, every SAP cloud solution comes with certain customization
							capabilities. Depending on the technology stack, this might vary from a
							fully fledged customization for existing business objects, through
							creating custom business objects, and up to generating native user
							interfaces based on the customized objects. Some of the SAP technology
							stacks allow implementation teams to even do some simple coding, which
							is then executed natively as part of the customized product. Regardless
							of how feature-rich the extended solution is, <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>
							adds much more to the extension capabilities and enables you to build a
							large number of extension scenarios and interact with on-premise and
							cloud systems.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">Loosely coupled applications<p class="p">As a minimum, extension application need a configured Single
							Sign-On (SSO) with the extended SAP solution. All the SAP cloud
							solutions provide the means for such configuration - you can either
							leverage the solution local integrated SAML 2.0-compliant identity
							provider, or by using the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication
                                service</span> as
							a central trust point in the landscape. As a rule of thumb, if you want
							to integrate a number of different SAML 2.0-compliant solutions in your
							landscape, a central trust management point such as <span class="ph pname">Identity Authentication</span>
							will significantly simplify the management of additional trusts.
							Furthermore, <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>
							comes pre-integrated with <span class="ph pname">Identity Authentication</span>.</p>
<p class="p">Another aspect of the loosely coupled applications is that you
							have to ensure the end-to-end user identity propagation going across all
							the extension application layers. This means that if, for example, a
							user has logged on to an HTML5 application, it has to be the same user
							on behalf of which all the underlying backend calls are performed. To
							achieve this, you leveraging the SAML 2.0 bearer assertion
							authentication flow, which is the default way for accesing any SAP cloud
							solution API from <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>.
							You use the same approach for Java applications.</p>
