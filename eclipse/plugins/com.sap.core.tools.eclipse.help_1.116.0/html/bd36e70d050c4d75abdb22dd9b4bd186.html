	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Besides providing a user, some connect methods have an additional parameter to provide
		the IDs of additional principals to the document service.</p>

		<p class="p">If additional principals are provided, the user not only has his or her own permissions
			to access objects but in addition gets the access rights of these principles. If, for
			example, the user him or herself has no right to access a specific document but one of
			the additionally provided principals is allowed to read the content, then the user can
			also access the content in the context of this connection.</p>

		<p class="p">With this concept an application could also use roles (or even groups) in the ACLs by
			setting ACEs indicating these roles or groups. Then the roles of the current user can be
			evaluated during his connection calls and he is granted access rights according to his
			role (or group) membership.</p>

		<p class="p">It is very important to keep in mind that the additional principals are also opaque
			strings for the document service. This leaves it up to the application to decide what
			kind of information it sends as additional principals, including identifiers only known
			by the application itself. On the other hand, the application must ensure that there is
			no user with an ID similar to the additional principals, which the application uses in
			its ACLs because such a user might unintentionally get too many access rights.</p>

		<div class="note sap-example example"><span class="exampletitle">Example</span> 
			<p class="p">This example shows how to assign write and read permissions for two kinds of users: Authors
				and readers. Authors should have write access to documents and readers should only
				have read access to the documents. The application defines two roles, one for
				authors called <span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">author-role</span> and one for
				readers called <span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">reader-role</span>.</p>

			<p class="p">For more information about securing applications and using roles, see <cite class="cite">Securing
					Applications</cite>.</p>

			<p class="p">To set up permissions for authors and readers as described in our example, set the
				appropriate ACEs at the documents. The following code snippet shows how to set these
				permissions for a single document:</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">
    	Session session = ..;
    	Document document = ..;
    
    	String authorRole = "author-role";
    	String readerRole = "reader-role";

    	// list of ACEs which should be added
    	List&lt;Ace&gt; addAcl = new ArrayList&lt;Ace&gt;();

    	// build and add ACE for user authors
    	List&lt;String&gt; permissionsAuthor = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
    		permissionsAuthor.add("cmis:write");
    	Ace aceAuthor = session.getObjectFactory().createAce(authorRole, 
    		permissionsAuthor);
    	addAcl.add(aceAuthor);

    	// build and add ACE for user U2
    	List&lt;String&gt; permissionsReader = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
    	permissionsReader.add("cmis:read");
    	Ace aceReader = session.getObjectFactory().createAce(readerRole, 
    		permissionsReader);
    	addAcl.add(aceReader);

    	// we remove all ACEs currently set
    	List&lt;Ace&gt; removeAcl = document.getAcl().getAces();

    	// add and remove the ACEs at the folder
    	document.applyAcl(addAcl, removeAcl, AclPropagation.OBJECTONLY);

</pre></div>

			<p class="p">The next code snippet shows how the author and reader roles are automatically
				determined for the users and propagated to the document service to provide the users
				the access rights they need.</p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">
    	import com.sap.security.um.service.UserManagementAccessor;
    	import com.sap.security.um.user.User;
    	import com.sap.security.um.user.UserProvider; 
    	â€¦

    	String authorRole = "author-role";
    	String readerRole = "reader-role";
      
    	// fetch current user and its roles
    	UserProvider userProvider = UserManagementAccessor.getUserProvider();
    	User currentUser = userProvider.getCurrentUser();
    	Set&lt;String&gt; roles = currentUser.getRoles();
      
    	// add author or reader role
    	List&lt;String&gt; additionalPrincipals = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
      
    	if (roles != null &amp;&amp; roles.contains(authorRole)){
    		additionalPrincipals.add(authorRole);
    	}
      	else if (roles != null &amp;&amp; roles.contains(readerRole)){
    		additionalPrincipals.add(readerRole);
    	}

    	// connect with additional role
    	String uniqueRepositoryName = ..;
    	String key = ..;
    
    	Session session = EcmFactory.connectForUser(uniqueRepositoryName, key, null,
    		currentUser.getName(), null, additionalPrincipals);

</pre></div>

			<p class="p">As long as the user's session is active, his or her permission to access the
				documents is determined by the user's role assignment. That is, authors can change
				documents and readers are only allowed to read them.</p>
