	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">An extension application usually consists of several layers. There is a front-end UI
		layer decoupled from the back end by OData, REST, or JSON services.</p>

		<p class="p">To achieve smooth retheming and rebranding, you implement the front end UI layer using
			SAPUI5. You can also use any HTML5 or JavaScript UI framework.</p>

		<p class="p"><span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> offers various tools and capabilities to help you create, customize,
			and integrate your extension front-end components.</p>

		<div class="p">The following artifacts are part of the UI package and delivered with the extension:<ul class="ul" id="loio21931b835c7e490eaefc21404ddf0a63__ul_usf_24r_cr">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Content – the actual business application wrapped as a widget or a tile</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Structure – navigation, pages, layout, templates, and themes, and other</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Metadata – metadata such as configuration information</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Mobile client - either a native client wrapping an HTML5 UI or a truly native
						mobile client</p>

				</li>

			</ul>
</div>

		<p class="p">The following graphic provides an overview of the building blocks of the extension
			application front end:</p>

		<p class="p"><img class="image" id="loio21931b835c7e490eaefc21404ddf0a63__image_hb2_gt1_gs" src="loio42b2e58343a74dcd803f25cbc561eb01_LowRes.png"/></p>

		<p class="p"> Extensions usually aggregate data from multiple different business systems by combining
			multiple application widgets on one or multiple pages. If you have to combine data and
			need to apply additional security checks, then you usually define a higher level
			back-end services in Java or XS, aggregating the required data and exposing it with a
			new REST, JSON or OData API to the UI tier. </p>

		<p class="p">The extension application UI can be based on the solution’s native UI technology (by
			leveraging solution-native genarted UIs) or on HTML5. The latter can either be served
			out of the Java or XS layer or most commonly, can leverage the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>
			HTML5 application infrastructure, thus ensuring clear decoupling between UI and back-end
			services. </p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Native customization</div><div type="Native customization">
			
			<p class="p">There are different native custumization options available with the SAP solutions. Most
				commonly, you can adjust the user interface by changing the initial product
				configuration, by adjusting object metadata, by manipulating field and operation
				visibility or by defining custom business objects. These customization options do
				not require any coding on the frond-end tier since the resulting UI is generated
				natively in the extended solution.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">SAPUI5 UI</div><div type="SAPUI5 UI">
			
			<p class="p">To achieve smooth retheming and rebranding, you leverage SAPUI5 for the extension UI.
				SAPUI5 allows smooth subsequent embedding of the custom UIs in the extended SAP
				solutions. The built-in extension and customization mechanisms of SAPUI5 make it
				easy to replace standard views, to customize i18N resource texts, to add new or to
				customize the existing navigation paths or even override existing code. Using SAPUI5
				is a good practice but you can also use other popular UI frameworks.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">SAP Cloud Platform Portal Service</div><div type="SAP Cloud Platform Portal Service">
			
			<p class="p">To achieve dynamic branding and retheming of extension UIs, we recommend that you use Portal
				service sites configured with a corresponding template to mimic the look and feel of
				the extended SAP solution. Furthermore, the Portal service allows dynamic redesign
				of pages leveraging the Portal authoring environment.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">SAP Web IDE</div><div type="SAP Web IDE">
			
			<p class="p">If you decide to go beyond pure configuration and customize the UI using SAPUI5, a
				natural choice would be SAP Web IDE. SAP Web IDE helps you develop, test, and deploy
				SAPUI5 applications in your <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> account, and expose your
				applications as widgets. It offers various extension templates such as SAPUI5
				templates which you can use to start with. Based on the OData services of the
				extended solution and on their metadata, you can start creating and adjusting the
				new user interface. SAP Web IDE comes with a source code editor that helps you fine
				tune the generated HTML code on your own, leveraging code completion.</p>
