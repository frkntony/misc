			<p class="p">The service treats user names as opaque strings that are defined by the application. All actions in the document service are executed in the
				context of this named user or the currently logged-on user. That is, the service sets the <span class="keyword parmname">cmis:createdBy</span> and
					<span class="keyword parmname">cmis:lastModifiedBy</span> properties to the provided user name. The service also uses this user name to evaluate
				access control lists (ACLs). For more information, see the CMIS specification. The document service is not connected to a user
				management system and, therefore, does not perform any user authentication.</p>

			<p class="p">Repositories are identified either by their unique name or by their ID. The unique name is a human-readable name that should be constructed with
				Java package-name semantics, for example, <span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">com.foo.MySpecialRepository</span>, to avoid naming
				conflicts. Repositories in the document service are secured by a key provided by the application. When a repository is created, a key
				must be supplied. Any further attempts to connect to this repository only succeed if the key provided by the connecting application
				matches the key that was used to create the repository. Therefore, this key must be stored in a secure manner, for example, using the
				Java KeyStore. It is, however, up to the application to decide whether to share this key with other applications from the same account
				to implement data-sharing scenarios.</p>

			<p class="p">Multiple applications can access the same repository. However, applications can only
				connect to the same repository using the unique name assigned to this repository if
				they are deployed within the same account as the application that created the
				repository. In contrast, applications that are deployed in a different account
				cannot access this repository. A consequence of having repositories isolated within
				an account is that data cannot be shared across different accounts.</p>

			<p class="p">Repository ABC is created when Application<sub class="ph sub">1</sub> is deployed in Account<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>.
					Application<sub class="ph sub">2</sub> is located in the same Account<sub class="ph sub">1</sub> as
					Application<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>; therefore, Application<sub class="ph sub">2</sub> can also access the
				same repository using its unique name ABC. Application<sub class="ph sub">3</sub> is deployed in
					Account<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>. Application<sub class="ph sub">3</sub> calls a repository that has the
				same unique name ABC as the other repository that belongs to Account<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>.
				However, Application<sub class="ph sub">3</sub> cannot access the ABC repository that belongs to
					Account<sub class="ph sub">1</sub> using the identical unique name, because the repositories
				are isolated within the account. Therefore, Application<sub class="ph sub">3</sub> in
					Account<sub class="ph sub">2</sub> connects to another ABC repository that belongs to
					Account<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>. In summary, a repository can only be accessed by
				applications that are deployed in the same account as the application that created
				the repository.</p>

			<div class="p">The document service supports multitenancy and isolates data between tenants. Each application consuming the document service creates a
				repository and provides a unique name and a secret key. The document service creates the repository internally in the context of the
				tenant using the application. While the repository name uniquely identifies the repository, an internal ID is created for the
				application for each tenant. This ID identifies the storage area containing all the data for the tenant in this repository. An
				application that uses the document service in this way has multitenancy support. No additional logic is required at the application
					level.<div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip</span> 
					<p class="p">One document service session is always bound to one tenant and to one user. If you create the session
                                only once, then store it statically, and finally reuse it for all subsequent requests, you end up in the tenant where
                                you first created the document service session. That is: You do not use multitenancy.</p>

					<p class="p">We recommend that you create one document service session per tenant and cache these sessions for
                                future reuse. Make sure that you do not mix up the tenants on your side.</p>

					<p class="p">If you expect a high load for a specific tenant, we recommend that you create a pool of sessions for
                                that tenant. A session is always bound to a particular server of the document service and this will not scale. If you
                                use a session pool, the different sessions are bound to different document service servers and you will get a much
                                better performance and scaling. </p>
