		<p class="p">The host application without the application does not allow the user (call center employee) to
			see any feedback on his/her daily work. The user does not really know how s/he performs
			compared to other colleagues either. </p>

		<p class="p">The requirement for gamification in the demo applications is to intrinsically motivate the
			users with instant feedback (achievements). Collaborative feedback will be introduced,
			and the progress for each individual user will be visible as well as the performance
			compared to others.</p>

		<p class="p">To meet the introduced gamification requirements, an example gamification design is introduced.
			All users (call center employees) are considered as players where the gamification
			concept will apply. </p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Points Categories</div><div type="Points Categories">
			
			<p class="p">Points are introduced to represent the experience of the users: </p>

			<p class="p">“Experience Points” (XP) </p>

			<p class="p">“Critical Tickets” (CT) </p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Levels</div><div type="Levels">
			
			<p class="p">Based on the number of experience points a user gains, s/he can reach different levels. Three
				levels are introduced:</p>

			<p class="p">“Novice” - this level can be reached already with 0 “Experience Points”</p>

			<p class="p">“Competent” - this level can be reached once the user has gained 10 “Experience Points”</p>

			<p class="p">“Expert” - this level can be reached once the user has gained 50 “Experience Points”</p>

			<p class="p">Based on the successful completion of a mission, the user will gain a badge. The following
				badges are introduced:</p>

			<p class="p">“Troubleshooting Champion”</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Missions</div><div type="Missions">
			
			<p class="p">Missions will be introduced to motivate continuous efforts. The following missions will be

			<p class="p">For each processed ticket, the user will gain 1 “Experience point”.</p>

			<p class="p">For each processed ticket categorized as “critical”, the user will gain 2 additional
				“Experience Points” to motivate him or her to solve critical tickets with higher
				priority.</p>

			<p class="p">For each processed ticket categorized as “critical”, the user will gain 1 “Critical
				Tickets” point.</p>

			<p class="p">Once a user has processed 5 critical tickets (gained 5 “Critical Tickets” points),
				the “Troubleshooting” mission is completed.</p>

			<p class="p">Once the mission troubleshooting is completed, the user will gain the
				“Troubleshooting Champion” badge.</p>
