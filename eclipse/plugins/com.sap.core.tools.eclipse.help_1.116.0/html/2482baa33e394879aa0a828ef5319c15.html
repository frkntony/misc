			<p class="p">At development time, SAPUI5 controls consist of four parts:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio2482baa33e394879aa0a828ef5319c15__ul_mwp_fq5_dp"><li class="li">
					<p class="p">Control API defining the properties, events, methods, as well as the
						associations and aggregations of a control</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Control renderer for creating the HTML string that defines the structure of
						the control</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Control behavior which is the JavaScript code taking care of the control
						interactivity, reacting on user events, firing control events, and handling
						method calls and property changes</p>

				</li>
<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Control sytle defining the visuals of the control; usually, a control has
						different visual designs, bundled as themes</p>

				</li>
</ul>

			<p class="p">Elements are similar to controls, but are more leightweight. They are defined in the
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Element</samp> class. As they are not supposed to be used
				stand-alone in a page, they usually do <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span> have a renderer.
				Elements are usually aggregated by controls which use them as a sort of structured
				data container with API and also do the rendering of the elements.</p>

			<p class="p">The following process describes the required steps for writing a SAPUI5 control from
				scratch in an Eclipse infrastructure. It does not provide a detailed step-by-step
				procedure.</p>

		</div><div class="tasklabel"><h2 class="sectiontitle tasklabel">Procedure</h2></div><ol class="ol steps"><li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">Creating the control files</span><div class="itemgroup info">
					<p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">New Control</span> wizard generates the following files
						(X stands for the control name):</p>

					<ul class="ul" id="loio2482baa33e394879aa0a828ef5319c15__ul_gbh_xc1_2p"><li class="li">
							<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">X.control</samp> - Control API definition: Bases on an XML
								file, which can also be edited directly in case of problems with the
								form-based editor. From this file, the JavaScript is generated, for
								example, the control constructor, the inheritance, as well as the
								getters and setters for the control properties. The methods declared
								in the API are <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span> generated, but have to be
								implemented from scratch in the behavior JS file
									(<samp class="ph codeph">X.js</samp>). By being XML-based, the file can be
								easily used to generate the control API also in other languages like
								Java or APAB.</p>

						</li>
<li class="li">
							<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">XRenderer.js</samp> - JavaScript control renderer: Provides
								the static <samp class="ph codeph">render(oRenderManager, oControl)</samp> method.
								This method reads the control instance data and writes the according
								HTML to the <samp class="ph codeph">RenderManager</samp>.</p>

						</li>
<li class="li">
							<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">X.js</samp> - Defines the control "behavior"</p>

						</li>
<li class="li">
							<p class="p"><samp class="ph codeph">X.css</samp> - Style definition for the control. There is
								one CSS file per visual design in
									<samp class="ph codeph">themes/&lt;themename&gt;/X.css</samp> and, similar to the
								CRM HTML UI, there is also a special theme named "base" which
								contains the CSS that is more or less independent from the visual
								appearance and rather required to make the control work properly.
								This CSS is always loaded before the theme-specific CSS.</p>

						</li>
</ul>

					<p class="p">When you use the <span class="ph uicontrol">New Control</span> wizard, these files are
						created automatically and already contain template content that represents a
						simple control that works and that you can use as starting point for your
						control.</p>

				</div></li>
<li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">Creating a test page</span><div class="itemgroup info">
					<p class="p">Create the <samp class="ph codeph">X.html</samp> file in the library project under
							<samp class="ph codeph">src/test/uilib/&lt;libraryname&gt;</samp>. You use this page for
						testing your code during development of your control. It does
							<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span> use a test framework. It is a rather simple
						application page that focuses on your control. Also, because of its
						location, this page automatically appears in the SAPUI5 test suite. The test
						suite is available, for example, when you deploy the
							<samp class="ph codeph">uilib-sample</samp> application. It is then located at
							<samp class="ph codeph">http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/uilib-sample</samp>.</p>

					<p class="p">To access the page without using the test suite, open the following page in
						your browser:
							<samp class="ph codeph">http://localhost:8080/uilib-sample/test-resources/sap/ui/commons/X.html</samp>.
						Make sure that you use the correct server, port, and library name.</p>

<li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">Defining the control API</span><div class="itemgroup info">
					<p class="p">This step and the following two steps (implementing the control renderer and
						implementing the control behavior) are usually done iteratively to increment
						the control functionality.</p>

				</div></li>
<li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">Implementing the control renderer</span><div class="itemgroup info">
					<p class="p">For information about implementing a control renderer, see <a class="xref" href="91f393916f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html">Writing a Control Renderer</a>.</p>

				</div></li>
<li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">Implementing the control behavior</span><div class="itemgroup info">
					<p class="p">For the most common event types, it is sufficient to create an
							<samp class="ph codeph">on&lt;eventName&gt;</samp> method that is called when the event
						occurs. For more exotic events, you need an explicit event registration. For
						more information, see <a class="xref" href="91f1b3856f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html">Browser Events</a>.</p>

				</div></li>
<li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">Defining the control style</span><div class="itemgroup info">
					<p class="p">Initially, you pick one visual design and do all the CSS within the base
						theme, that is, in the themes/base/X.css file which is picked up
						automatically by the build. Only later you identify basic CSS parts that
						remain there and theme-specific CSS parts that you move to the respective
						theme and you also define CSS for other themes.</p>

				</div></li>
<li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">Creating a QUnit test page</span><div class="itemgroup info">
					<p class="p">QUnit is the preferred unit testing framework for SAPUI5. It has two advantages compared to
						jsUnit: The possibility to perform async tests and a direct test execution
						without deploying a test framework. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="708002929ea548fd9433954a9275eb5f.html">QUnit Testing
							Fundamentals</a>.</p>

				</div></li>
<li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">Creating QTP tests</span><div class="itemgroup info">
					<p class="p">Whereas unit tests only test local aspects, QTP tests are also executed
						automatically, but cover more the aspects of using the control within a
						browser page/scenario with user interaction and also test the visual
						appearance. As specific knowledge is required, we recommend that these tests
						are written by QM representatives.</p>

<li class="li step stepexpand"><span class="ph cmd">Creating the themes</span><div class="itemgroup info">
					<p class="p">Depending on the control's stakeholders, the list of themes that need to be
