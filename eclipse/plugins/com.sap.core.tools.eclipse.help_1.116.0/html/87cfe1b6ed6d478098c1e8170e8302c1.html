				<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> In all cases, first test your update in a non-productive environment. The newly deployed

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Description</span>: Rolling update with soft shutdown</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Use</span>: When your new application version is backward compatible
				with the old version - that is, the new version of the application can work in
				parallel with the already running old application version.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Steps</span>: Deploy a new version of the application and disable and enable
				processes in a rolling manner. For an automated execution of the same procedure, use
				the rolling-update command.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Planned Downtime (Maintenance Mode)</div><div type="Planned Downtime (Maintenance Mode)">
			
			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Description</span>: Shows a custom maintenance page to end users. The
				application is automatically disabled.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Use</span>: When the new version is backward incompatible - that is, running the
				old and the new version in parallel may lead to inconsistent data or erroneous
				output.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Steps</span>: Enable maintenance mode to redirect new connections to the
				maintenance application. Deploy and start the new application version and then
				disable maintenance mode. </p>

			<p class="p">See <a class="xref" href="aa04f29a908f4db7b7666c12552ddd53.html" title="An operator can start and stop planned application downtime, during which a customized maintenance page for that application is shown to end users.">Using Maintenance Mode for Planned Downtimes</a></p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Soft Shutdown</div><div type="Soft Shutdown">
			
			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Description</span>: Supports zero downtime and planned downtime
				scenarios. Disabled applications/processes stop accepting new connections from
				users, but continue to serve already running connections.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Use</span>: As part of the zero downtime scenario or to gracefully shut down
				your application during a planned downtime (without maintenance mode).</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Steps</span>: Disable the application (console client only) or individual
				processes (console client or cockpit) in order to shut down the application or
				processes gracefully. </p>
