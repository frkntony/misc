	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform, streaming analytics</span> is an SAP
		HANA component that provides the ability to build applications that process streams of
		incoming event data in real time, and to collect and act on incoming information. </p>

		<div class="p"><span class="ph pname">Streaming analytics</span> is ideally suited
			for situations where data arrives as events happen, and where there is value in
			collecting, understanding, and acting on this data right away. Some examples of data
			sources that produce streams of events in real time include: <ul class="ul" id="loio09beb17796d544c7a713620f9071292c__ul_qb1_3bp_h5">
				<li class="li">Sensors</li>

				<li class="li">Smart devices</li>

				<li class="li">Web sites (click streams)</li>

				<li class="li">IT systems (logs)</li>

				<li class="li">Financial markets (prices)</li>

				<li class="li">Social media</li>

			</ul>
You can actively monitor data arriving from various sources, and set alerts to be
			triggered when immediate attention is warranted. For example, you can alert operations
			staff to imminent equipment failure, or target marketing offers to customers based on
			context.</div>

		<p class="p">This figure shows a typical <span class="ph pname">streaming analytics</span> deployment
			on the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>.
			Continuous queries, which you develop and test as projects using the SAP HANA smart data
			streaming plugin for SAP HANA studio, are deployed to<span class="ph pname">streaming analytics</span> on the
				<span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>. SAP HANA

					<li class="li">You must have an SAP HANA instance with a minimum size of 256GB associated

						account. If you are using SP 10, it must be at least revision 102.04; if you

					<li class="li">For an SAP HANA SP 12 instance, <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform, streaming analytics</span>
						must be at least SP 11 revision 112.08, or SP 12 revision 122.07. </li>

					<li class="li">Any on-premise smart data streaming components must be the same version as the streaming
						server on the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>.</li>

					<li class="li"><span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform, streaming analytics</span> only supports single-tenant databases. You cannot use any version of

					<li class="li">The Streaming Web Service and the Web Services Provider are preconfigured

						port numbers, as connections to the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> will
						no longer work.</li>

					<li class="li">The Web Services Provider uses REST connections. In this implementation, it
