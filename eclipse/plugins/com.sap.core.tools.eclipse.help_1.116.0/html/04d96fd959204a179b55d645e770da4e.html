<h1 class="title topictitle1">Performance Tips</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">In many ways the document service behaves like a relational data base where every
		document and folder is one entry.</p>
<p class="p">Therefore most of the performance tips for data bases also hold for the document service
			like the following ones:</p>
<div class="p">
			<ul class="ul" id="copycopy04d96fd959204a179b55d645e770da4e__ul_a5j_xx2_wn"><li class="li">Use selective queries and do not fetch too many objects.</li>
<li class="li">Do not filter objects in the application if this is possible in the document service.</li>
<li class="li">Try to reduce the information you request for the objects, for example, only request the
					ACLs or the allowed actions if you really need them. Furthermore, try to reduce
					the set of properties you query to only those your application really depends
					on.</li>
</ul>

		</div>
<p class="p">To help you improve the performance of your application that uses the document service,
			we provide the following tips.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> These are only recommendations that may not be suitable in every case. There may be
			situations, in which you cannot and should not apply them.</div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Keep the Number of Repositories Small</div><div type="Keep the Number of Repositories Small">
			
			<p class="p">Documents and folders are stored in the document service in different repositories. Creating
				many repositories entails a significant CPU usage and a significant storage
				consumption even if no documents are stored.</p>

			<div class="note sap-recommendation recommendation"><span class="recommendationtitle">Recommendation</span> 
				<p class="p">We recommend that you keep the total number of repositories to a minimum. Avoid, for example,
					creating a separate repository for every user, especially if the users do not
					have large amounts of data to store. In such a situation, rather create only one
					repository and store the user data in several separate folders.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="p">As a rule of thumb, if an application uses more than 10 repositories and if the
				amount of data in these repositories is small, consider using folders instead of
				repositories. If each repository contains a large set of data (more than 100 GB),
				using many repositories is not a problem.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Prevent getChildren Calls on Large Folders</div><div type="Prevent getChildren Calls on Large Folders">
			
			<p class="p">For folders that contain many children, performance might be impaired when you
				navigate into such a folder using a
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">getChildren</span> call. If you navigate into
				such a folder to analyze its data, for example, using the CMIS Workbench, this
				analysis becomes complicated. In contrast, fetching a child in a folder with many
				children using its object ID or its path is not a problem.</p>

			<p class="p">To define "large" folder is difficult. If you send only one
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">getChildren</span> call per hour, a thousand
				or more children are totally OK but if you send many calls per second even 100
				children might be too much. In any case, the load caused by calling this method
				increases linearly with the number of children.</p>

			<p class="p">As an alternative to one folder with many children you might consider subdividing the
				children into different subfolders or even a subfolder hierarchy. Yet another option
				is to use the query method with the
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">IN_FOLDER</span> predicate together with
				additional restrictions to limit the number of matching results instead of using the
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">getChildren</span> call.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Do Not Use Large Skip Counts</div><div type="Do Not Use Large Skip Counts">
			
			<p class="p">Several CMIS methods have a skip count parameter, for example, the
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">getChildren</span> or the
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">query</span> method. Using large skip counts
				produces a significant load because a huge number of matching result objects is
				found and skipped before the final result set can be collected. To prevent the need
				of large skip counts, try to reduce the number of matching results by subdividing
				the children into different subfolders or by using a more selective query.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Avoid Using a Sort Criterion (for example, getChildren, query)</div><div type="Avoid Using a Sort Criterion (for example, getChildren, query)">
			
			<p class="p">Only use a sort criterion if you really need it because it might reduce performance
				significantly (see also <cite class="cite">Paging with maxItems and skipCount (for example, for
					getChildren, query)</cite> in <a class="xref" href="fbff09485f0040df804859e047686b8c.html" title="Answers to frequently asked questions on the document service.">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Do Not Request All Properties of an Object</div><div type="Do Not Request All Properties of an Object">
			
			<p class="p">In the operational context (see the
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">OperationalContext.java</span> class), you can
				define the properties that are to be returned together with the selected objects. Do
				not query for all properties because this might be time consuming and it increases
				the amount of data transferred over the network. Especially, requesting the
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">cmis:path</span> property can be inefficient
				because it has to be computed for each call. The general rule behind this is to
				reduce the amount of data you fetch from the document service and hold also for
				other information you might request together with the objects like the ACLs or
				allowed actions.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Prefer Access Using the Object ID Over Access Using the Path</div><div type="Prefer Access Using the Object ID Over Access Using the Path">
			
			<p class="p">Accessing an object using its ID is much faster than using its path.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Prevent Using getFolderTree, getDescendants, and IN_TREE on Large Hierarchies</div><div type="Prevent Using getFolderTree, getDescendants, and IN_TREE on Large Hierarchies">
			
			<p class="p">Using the <span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">getFolderTree</span> or
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">getDescendants</span> method on large
				hierarchies is very inefficient. The same is true for the folder predicate
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">IN_TREE</span> that you can use in the
				statement of the query method. All these methods are slow for large hierarchies even
				if the final result set is small.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Reuse OpenCmis Session Objects</div><div type="Reuse OpenCmis Session Objects">
			
			<p class="p">When applications use the document service they fetch a session object using one of the
				connect methods. Creating a session is a quite expensive operation that should be
				reused and shared if possible. A session object is thread-safe and allows parallel
				method calls.</p>

			<p class="p">Usually, a session is bound to a user. To reduce the number of sessions that are created,
				fetch the session only for the first request of the user and store it in the user's
				HTTP session. Then the session can be reused in subsequent requests of this
				user.</p>

			<p class="p">If an application uses a service user to connect the session to the document service,
				we recommend that you store this session in a central place and reuse it for all
				subsequent requests.</p>

			<p class="p">When you share a session object, observe the following tips:</p>

			<div class="p">
				<ul class="ul" id="copycopy04d96fd959204a179b55d645e770da4e__ul_j24_q2f_pn"><li class="li">A session object has an internal cache, for example, for already fetched objects. To make
						sure that you fetch the latest version of specific objects, clear the cache
						from time to time.</li>
<li class="li">If a session is used for a very long time, problems might occur that result in exceptions
						(for example, network connection problems). A possible solution for this is
						to replace the failing session by a new one. However, do not replace a
						session if an <span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">ObjectNotFound</span>
						exception is thrown because you tried to fetch a non-existing document or
						folder. This is also true for similar situations, where the exception is
						part of the normal method behavior.</li>
</ul>
