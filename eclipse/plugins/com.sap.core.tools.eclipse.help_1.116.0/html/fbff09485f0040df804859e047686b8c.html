			<p class="p">The document service executes several backups a day to prevent file loss due to disasters.
				Backups are kept for 14 days and then deleted. Backups are not needed for simple
				hard disk crashes, since all storage hardware is based on redundant hard disks.</p>

			<p class="p">If you implement paging using <span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">maxItems</span> and
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">skipCount</span>, be aware that the different
				calls might be send to different database servers each returning the result objects
				in a possibly different order. To get a consistent result for these calls, add a
				unique sort criterion so that each server returns the objects using the same order.
				Be aware that using a sort criterion might reduce the processing speed
				significantly. Therefore, only use a sort criterion if really needed.</p>
