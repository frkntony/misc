<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> offers a hash-based navigation, which allows you to build one-page apps where the
        navigation is done by changing the hash, so the browser does not have to reload the page.
        Instead there is a callback to which the app and especially the affected view can react. A
        string, that is, the hash is used, parsed and matched against patterns which will then
        inform the handlers.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> uses Crossroads.js for parsing the hash and the Hasher framework for manipulating
            the hash. You can find more information about Crossroads.js and the Hasher framework on
            GitHub.</p>
<div class="p">Navigation is used for the following use cases:<ul class="ul" id="loio3d18f20bd2294228acb6910d8e8a5fb5__ul_scj_gk2_1p"><li class="li">
                    <p class="p">Browser History Handling</p>

                    <p class="p">On mobile devices you do not only have the browser back but also physical
                        back buttons (android).</p>

                </li>
<li class="li">
                    <p class="p">Bookmarks/Deep Links</p>

                    <p class="p">Bookmark/deep link a page inside an app; this means that you can start the
                        app and resume the bookmarked state</p>

                </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">Hash-based navigation enables you to pass data from the hash to any view, and to adjust
            the current hash so that you can use it as a bookmarkable URL. It also enables the user
            to use the browser history buttons for navigation and depending on the hash you can also
            generate views automatically.</p>
<p class="p">The following general rules apply:</p>
<ul class="ul" id="loio3d18f20bd2294228acb6910d8e8a5fb5__ul_zd5_hl2_1p"><li class="li">
                <p class="p">The user can always navigate back to the previous page.</p>

            </li>
<li class="li">
                <p class="p">Each full page change creates an entry in the back chain (browser history).</p>

            </li>
<li class="li">
                <p class="p">Most pages can be bookmarked.</p>

            </li>
<li class="li">
                <p class="p">Dialogs and popovers can <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">not</span> be bookmarked.</p>

            </li>
</ul>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Pattern Matching</div><div type="Pattern Matching">
            
            <p class="p">A route is used to notify your application that the hash has changed to a certain
                value. When a route matches the hash, it provides the data passed over the hash to a
                defined handler. The pattern of the route is matched against the hash. If the
                pattern matches your application will also get the parameters.</p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph">For more information about the structure of patterns, see <a class="xref" href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.core.routing.Route.html%23constructor" target="_blank">sap.ui.core.routing.Route.html#constructor</a></span></p>

            <p class="p">When defining routes, the order is important: Only the first route that matches is
                informed. You can activate greedy for a route, meaning that events will be fired
                even if another route has already matched. All routes defined after the first route
                that was hit are ignored. If you define a catchall route, always define it as the
                last route. </p>

            <p class="p"><span class="ph">For better understanding of how pattern works and how catched parameters look like,
