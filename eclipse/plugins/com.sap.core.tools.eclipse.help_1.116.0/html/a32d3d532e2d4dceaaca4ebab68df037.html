	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"> The cockpit provides an overview of all the platform services that you can access and
		use for creating or extending applications. Services are grouped by service
		category.</p>

		<div class="p">Some of the services are basic services, which are directly provided by the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> and are ready-to-use. In addition, extended
			services are available. Which services are available for use in the relevant account, differs for each account. In the overview of the
			services available in the account, a label on the tile for the service in question indicates if the service is enabled. You can only use
			these services.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<p class="p">An account administrator must first enable the services and apply the service-specific configuration (for example, configure the
					corresponding roles and destinations) before users of the account can access these services.</p>

				<p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Enable</span> option appears only if you have the Administrator role for the account in question and for the
					services that need further enablement.</p>

			</div>
</div>

			<p class="p">The representation of the details for each service in the cockpit varies to some
				degree.</p>

			<div class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Service Description</span> section offers the following:<ul class="ul" id="loioa32d3d532e2d4dceaaca4ebab68df037__ul_prg_tqv_tw">
					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">A short description for the selected service</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">A link to the documentation for the selected service</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">A link to the service UI (depends on the service). Only some of the
							services provide a UI as some are only consumable via API.</p>

					</li>

				</ul>
</div>

			<p class="p"> The <span class="ph uicontrol">Service Configuration</span> section offers the following:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loioa32d3d532e2d4dceaaca4ebab68df037__ul_lkj_jrv_tw">
				<li class="li">
					<div class="p">No, one or more links to configuration screens of the service (depends on the service)<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
							<p class="p">Some services provide further configuration options, while others
								don’t.</p>

						</div>
</div>

				</li>

			</ul>

			<div class="note remember"><span class="remembertitle">Remember</span> 
				<p class="p">You can only access most of the links after the service has been enabled.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="p">To view the list of services available to you in a specific account, you have the following options: </p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loioa32d3d532e2d4dceaaca4ebab68df037__ul_hyw_w1q_gq">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Choose <span class="ph uicontrol">Services</span> in the navigation area.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">On the account overview page, click the links in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Services</span> tile.</p>

				</li>

			</ul>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<p class="p">Some of the services are exposed only on the trial landscape for developer
					accounts. That means the services are not, or not yet, released on the
					productive landscape for customer and partner accounts.</p>

				<p class="p">Some of the services are only exposed if you have purchased a license for them
					before.</p>
