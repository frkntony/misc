	<div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can view details about the Java quota and virtual machines quota purchased for a
		global account and how it is distributed between the accounts in this global account. As
		long as there are free quotas, you can freely distribute them between the
		accounts.</p>

		
		<div class="section prereq p"><div class="tasklabel"><h2 class="sectiontitle tasklabel">Prerequisites</h2></div>You have the Administrator role for the accounts for which you want to manage the
			quota.</div>

		
		<div class="section context"><div class="tasklabel"><h2 class="sectiontitle tasklabel">Context</h2></div>
			<p class="p">The overview of accounts available to you is your starting point for viewing quota
				information in the cockpit. The overview shows the different quotas in use, how they
				are distributed between individual accounts, and how many free quotas there are for
				which purchased edition. For example, there are 2 free Java quotas out of 5 that can
				be used in the different accounts. </p>

			<p class="p">On the <span class="ph uicontrol">Quota Management</span> page in the cockpit, you can view
				quota information
				per account
				and edition, and manage quota for the currently selected global
				account. The quota purchased for a global account is available to the applications
				deployed in all accounts in this global
				account. The
				quota assigned to individual accounts in the global account must not exceed the
				purchased limits. You can free quotas by removing them from an
				account. Quotas are sold in different editions.
				</p>

			<p class="p">In the editing
				mode,
				use
				the <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">+</span> and <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">–</span> buttons to adjust the quota in
				the specified limits.</p>

			<p class="p">Note the following:</p>

							Management</span> will only be enabled if you have the
						Administrator role for at least one account in this global account.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">You need the Administrator role for the account in question to be able to
						change the quota. Otherwise, the <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">+</span> and
							<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">–</span> buttons are disabled and you can only view how
						the quota is distributed.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">There is a category <span class="ph uicontrol">Other Accounts</span> for which the total
						quota of all accounts belonging to this category is displayed, but no
						details. These are the accounts to which you are not assigned as member and
						that you cannot access.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">You cannot decrease quota any further if it is still in use. You first need
						to release some resources before you can continue (that means, stop some of
						the applications or processes in that account).</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">You cannot increase quota any further if you have reached the limit of your
						purchased quota because you have distributed all the available quota
						already.</p>

				</li>

				
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">You can filter the quota information by quota type and by account.</p>
