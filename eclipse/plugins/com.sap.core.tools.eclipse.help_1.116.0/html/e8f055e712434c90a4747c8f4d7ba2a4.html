		<p class="p">The major principle for the connectivity established by the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> is that the
				<span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>
			administrator should have full control over the connection to the cloud, i.e. they
			should be able to decide if and when the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> need to be
			connected to the cloud at all, to which accounts it shall be connected, and which
			on-premise systems and resources shall be accessible to applications of the connected
			account.</p>

		<p class="p">Using the administration UI, the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>
			administrator can connect and disconnect the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> to the
			configured cloud account. Once disconnected, there is no communication possible â€“
			neither between the cloud account and the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> nor to the
			internal systems. The connection state can be verified and changed by the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>
			administrator on the Account Dashboard tab of the UI as shown in the following screen
			shot:</p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> Bear in mind that once the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> is freshly
			installed and connected to a cloud account, still none of the systems available in the
			customer network will be accessible to the applications of the related cloud account.
			The systems and resources that shall be made accessible must be configured explicitly in
			the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> one
			by one. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="0c48337629d3494888f7b9d06855ba6e.html">Configuring Trust between Cloud Connector and On-Premise Systems</a></div>

		<p class="p"> Effective <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>
			version <kbd class="ph userinput">2.2.0</kbd>, a single <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> instance
			can be connected to multiple accounts in the cloud. This is useful especially for
			customers who need multiple accounts to structure their development or to stage their
			cloud landscape into development, test, and production. These customers have the option
			to use a single <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> instance
			for multiple accounts of theirs. Nevertheless, it is recommended to not use accounts
			running productive scenarios and accounts used for development or test purposes within
			the same <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>. A cloud account can be added to or deleted from a <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>
				via<span class="ph uicontrol">Account Dashboard</span>, using the <span class="ph uicontrol">Add</span>
			and <span class="ph uicontrol">Delete</span> buttons (see screenshot above). </p>
