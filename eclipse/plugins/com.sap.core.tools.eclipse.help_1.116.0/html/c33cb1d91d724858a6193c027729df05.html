	<div class="body conbody">
		<p class="p">The gamification development cycle describes the processes involved in the introduction
			of gamification in existing or new applications. </p>

		<p class="p">In general, there three major processes are required:</p>

		<ul class="ul" id="loioc33cb1d91d724858a6193c027729df05__ul_efl_xw1_3r">
			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Creation of the gamification concept</p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Implementation of the gamification concept</p>

			</li>

			<li class="li">
				<p class="p">Integration with application (target application)</p>

			</li>

		</ul>

		<p class="p">Creation of the gamification concepts is a purely conceptual tasks that is typically
			executed by gamification designers. The task is executed during the design phase and
			covers the specification of a meaningful game / gamification design. </p>

		<p class="p">Implementation of the gamification concept covers the mapping of the gamification concept to
			the game mechanics offered by the <span class="ph pname">gamification service</span>.
			This task is normally performed by gamification designers and/or IT experts.</p>

		<p class="p">Integration with the application is a development tasks which covers the technical integration
			of the target application with the APIs of the <span class="ph pname">gamification service</span>.
			This is normally performed by application developers, since technical knowledge of the
			application is required (such as implementation points for listening for events or
			visual representation of achievements).</p>
