				information.</p>
<p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Favorite Applications</span> panel shows all applications that you have added to your

			<p class="p">The cockpit provides integrated access to all the accounts for which you have a user. Which accounts are shown to you in the cockpit, depends on
				the version of the cockpit you are using. For example, you can access all the accounts you operate on the productive landscape (at
					<span class="ph filepath">hana.ondemand.com</span>). If you also have a developer account that enables you to try out things in a
				non-productive environment, you need to access a separate cockpit (at <span class="ph filepath">hanatrial.ondemand.com</span>) in which you will
				only see your trial account created for this purpose.</p>

			<p class="p">For more information, see <a class="xref" href="350356d1dc314d3199dca15bd2ab9b0e.html" title="Applications can be deployed on the productive landscape hana.ondemand.com or the trial landscape hanatrial.ondemand.com.">Landscape Hosts</a> and <a class="xref" href="8ed4a705efa0431b910056c0acdbf377.html" title="An account is a hosted environment on SAP Cloud Platform in which users deploy applications and connect them to services.">Accounts</a>.</p>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">The data center</p>

					<p class="p">For customer and partner accounts, the logon URL differs in terms of the data center associated with the account, which is the physical

							<span class="ph filepath">https://account.hana.ondemand.com/cockpit</span> to log on to a customer or partner account located in
						Europe.</p>

			<p class="p">When you log on to the cockpit for the first time, you get to the account overview page. Depending on the use case, productive or trial, you can
				have a single or several accounts assigned to you. You can select an account in the overview page. You can then drill down to the

				The entries
				are grouped into categories. For example, choose <span class="ph uicontrol">Applications</span>
				to manage the applications for the account in
				question.</p>

			<p class="p">Use the breadcrumb navigation to access the different applications
				deployed in your account and associated
				activities.
				Note the following:</p>

				<li class="li">

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">The element that is currently selected appears as a hyperlink in the

			<p class="p">Use <span class="ph uicontrol">Notifications</span> to stay informed about different operations and

				The <span class="ph uicontrol">Notification</span> icon in the header toolbar provides a quick
				access to the list of notifications and shows the number of available notifications.
				The icon is visible only if there are currently notifications.</p>

			<p class="p">Each notification includes a short statement, a date and time, and the relevant account. A
				notification informs you about the status of an operation or asks for an action. For
				example, if copying an account failed, an administrator of the account can assign
				the corresponding notification to himself and provide a fix. The other members of
				this account will see that the notification is already assigned to someone else.</p>

			<p class="p">You have the following options:</p>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Assign a notification to yourself. It's possible also to unassign yourself
						from a notification without processing it further.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Once you have you completed the related action, you can set the status to
						complete. This dismisses the corresponding notification for everyone else.
					</p>

				</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">You can access the full list of notifications (also the ones you have dismissed
				earlier) by choosing <span class="ph uicontrol">Notifications</span> in the navigation area at
