				visualize the application log data coming from cloud foundry applications. For more
				information about Kibana, see the Kibana product documentation at
					<span class="ph filepath">https://www.elastic.co</span>.</p>

			<p class="p">You can access and analyze your application logs produced in the last few days. The
				exact timeframe depends on the overall log volume which is produced in the

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Overview</span> dashboard (default) to understand the evolution of logs and basic KPIs regarding
							failures, response time, and response size.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p"> Use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Usage</span> dashboard to investigate the actual requests, their URLs, user and component
							information.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Performance and Quality</span> dashboard to investigate failures and response times.</p>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Network and Load</span> dashboard to investigate network traffic and payloads.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">Use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Requests and Logs</span> dashboard to analyze the overall set of logs, and requests as well as their
						involved components.</li>

					<li class="li">Use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Statistics</span> dashboard to see how many logs where shipped for each of your components as well as

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">All UI content is available to all users.</p>

							and cannot be changed.</p>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Custom content can be created only within the <span class="ph uicontrol">ZZ</span>

					</li>

					<li class="li">
						<p class="p">Custom content may be overwritten or chaged by any user or after a

			<p class="p">You can now navigate across the dashboards, and set and pin filters in order to

				on a specific application, with specific response codes producing unexpected high
