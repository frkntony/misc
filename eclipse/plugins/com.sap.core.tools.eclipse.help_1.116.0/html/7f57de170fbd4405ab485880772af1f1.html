	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"/>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Administration of Shadow Instances</div><div type="Administration of Shadow Instances">
			
			<p class="p">There is few administration required (if possible) on the shadow instance. All
				configuration of tunnel connections, host mappings, access rules, and so on, must be
				maintained on the master instance. They can be replicated over to the shadow
				instance only for display reasons. You may want to modify the <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">check
					interval</span> (time between checks of whether the master is still alive)
				and the <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">takeover delay</span> (time the shadow waits to see whether
				the master would come back online, before taking over the master role itself).</p>

			<p class="p">Keep in mind:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio7f57de170fbd4405ab485880772af1f1__ul_i51_jgj_q4">
				<li class="li">The log level on master and shadow instances can be different.</li>

				<li class="li">Configuration for check interval and takeover delay is maintained on the shadow
					instance only, and will be transferred to the master for display.</li>

				<li class="li">Audit logs are written on the master instance only and will not be transferred
					to the shadow. That means, if the shadow has become master for a while, during
					which the original master was down, the audit log is potentially distributed
					over both master and shadow instances.</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">If you want to drop all configuration on the shadow that is related to the master,
				choose the <span class="ph uicontrol">Reset</span> button, but only if the shadow is not
				connected to the master.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Failover Process</div><div type="Failover Process">
			
			<p class="p">The shadow instance checks regularly if the master instance is still alive. Once the
				check fails, the shadow instance tries to re-establish the connection to the master
				instance for a time period specified by the takeover delay parameter.</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio7f57de170fbd4405ab485880772af1f1__ul_y2h_5gj_q4">
				<li class="li">If during this time, no connection was possible, the shadow tries to take over the master
					role. At this point, it is still possible for the master to be alive and the
					trouble to be caused by a network issue between the shadow and master. In any
					case, the shadow instance then tries to establish a tunnel to the given <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> account.
					If the original master is still alive (and consequently its tunnel to the cloud
					account is still active), this attempt will be denied and the shadow will remain
					in "shadow status", periodically pinging the master and trying to connect to the
					cloud, while the master is not yet reachable. </li>

				<li class="li">Otherwise, the cloud side allows the tunnel to be opened and the shadow instance
					therefore knows that the master is indeed down, and takes over its role.
					Starting this moment, the shadow instance displays the UI of a master instance
					and allows the usual operations of a master instance, e.g. starting/stopping
					tunnels, modifying the configuration, etc.</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">When the former master instance is started again, it first checks whether in the meantime the
				registered shadow instance has taken over the master role. In such a case, the
				master registers itself as a shadow instance on the former shadow (now master)
				instance. Thus, the two <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>
				installations, in fact, have switched their roles.</p>

			<p class="p"/>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> Only one shadow instance is supported. Any further shadow instances attempting to connect
				will be declined by the master instance.</div>

			<p class="p">The master considers a shadow as lost, if no check/ping is received from that shadow
				instance during a time interval of three times the check period. Only after this
				period, another shadow system can register itself.</p>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> On the master, it is possible to trigger a failover process by choosing the
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Switch Roles</span> button. If the shadow is up, this works as
				described before, but even if the shadow can not be reached, a role switch of the
				master can be enforced. Only enforce the switch if you are absolutely sure that this
				is right.</div>
