				SAP

				database
				systems (using schemas instead of tenant databases), see <a class="xref" href="2040a8a60de84c09994f64f74896b18f.html" title="Each application deployed on SAP Cloud Platform can be assigned one or more database schemas. A schema is associated with a particular account and is available solely to applications within this account.

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Create</div><div type="Create">
			
			<p class="p">You can create databases on database management systems in your account and assign
				properties like database size. The database is independent of any single application
				and has to be explicitly bound.</p>

			<p class="p">You can use a freely definable database ID. What elements you are allowed to use
				depends on the database type that you create. A database ID must only occur once
				throughout the databases in an account. Remember that the physical database name is
				not the same as the database ID.</p>

			<p class="p">You can create databases using the cockpit and the console client. In the cockpit,
				you can create databases at the account, the application, and the database system
				level.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Bind</div><div type="Bind">
			
			<p class="p">Bindings are identified by a data source name, which must only occur once in any one
				application. You can bind databases to applications based on an explicitly named
				data source or using the default data source. The main differences are as follows: </p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio6cc1db5f30214321833fc8ca77e4ee8f__ul_opm_jxr_tk">
				<li class="li">Explicitly named data source<p class="p">When you bind the database to an application, you
						specify a data source name. This establishes a named binding between the
						database and application, and allows the database to be addressed by the
						application. The data source name is equivalent to the name used for the
						JNDI lookup. </p>
<p class="p">Named bindings allow an application to be bound to more
						than one database and, in turn, to use more than one database at the same
						time. The databases can be distinguished by the binding names.</p>
</li>

				<li class="li">Default data source<div class="p">The database is bound to the application without an
						explicitly specified data source name, and is consequently associated with
						the default data source. The following applies:<ul class="ul" id="loio6cc1db5f30214321833fc8ca77e4ee8f__ul_m2l_qk5_3r">
							<li class="li">The database can be addressed by the application by any name.</li>

							<li class="li">The default data source is a convenient option for applications that
								require only one database. An application bound to the default data
								source cannot be bound to any additional databases.</li>

						</ul>
</div>
</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">You can share a database between applications by binding the same database to more
				than one application. Remember the following when binding databases to
				applications:</p>

			<div class="p">
				<ul class="ul" id="loio6cc1db5f30214321833fc8ca77e4ee8f__ul_unp_txr_tk">
					<li class="li">An applicationâ€™s bindings are based on either named data sources or the
						default data source. An application cannot use a combination of the two
						types of bindings. </li>

					<li class="li">When named data sources are used, binding names must only occur once in any
						one application.</li>

				</ul>

			</div>

			<p class="p">When you bind the database to an application, you specify a custom logon, which
				consists of a database user name and a password, that is then used by the
				application to access the database.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Delete</div><div type="Delete">
			
			<p class="p">You should drop a database if it is no longer required, or if you want to redeploy an
				application from scratch cleaning old data.</p>

			<p class="p">Before deleting a database, you should explicitly remove any bindings that still
				exist between the database and an application. You can also remove all bindings by
				enforcing deletion of the database by executing the corresponding console client
				command. </p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Restart</div><div type="Restart">
			
			
			<p class="p">If your databases are not working properly, you can try to solve the issues by
				restarting either the whole SAP HANA database system, or a single tenant
				database.</p>

			
			
			<p class="p">To restart a single tenant database instead of the whole database system, use the
