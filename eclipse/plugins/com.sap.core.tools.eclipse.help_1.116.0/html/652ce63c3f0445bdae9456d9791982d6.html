<h1 class="title topictitle1">Performance Tips (HANA XS)</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">In many ways the document service behaves like a relational database, where each
		document and folder is one entry.</p>
<p class="p">Therefore. most of the performance tips for databases also apply to the document service, for
			example:</p>
<div class="p">
			<ul class="ul" id="loio652ce63c3f0445bdae9456d9791982d6__ul_a5j_xx2_wn"><li class="li">Use selective queries and do not fetch too many objects.</li>
<li class="li">Do not filter objects in the application if this is possible in the document service.</li>
<li class="li">Try to reduce the amount of information you request for the objects, for example, only
					request the ACLs or the allowed actions if you really need them. Furthermore,
					try to reduce the set of properties that you query to just those your
					application really depends on.</li>
</ul>

		</div>
<p class="p">To help you improve the performance of your application that uses the document service,
			we provide the following tips.</p>
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> These are only recommendations, and may not be suitable in every case. There may be
			situations where you cannot and should not apply them.</div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Keep the Number of Repositories Small</div><div type="Keep the Number of Repositories Small">
			
			<p class="p">Documents and folders are stored in the document service in different repositories. Creating a
				large number of repositories entails significant CPU usage and requires a
				considerable amount of storage, even if no documents are stored.</p>

			<div class="note sap-recommendation recommendation"><span class="recommendationtitle">Recommendation</span> 
				<p class="p">We recommend that you keep the total number of repositories to a minimum. Avoid, for example,
					creating a separate repository for every each, especially if the users do not
					have large amounts of data to store. In such a situation, create just one
					repository instead and store the user data in several separate folders.</p>

			</div>

			<p class="p">As a rule of thumb, if an application uses more than 10 repositories and if the
				amount of data in these repositories is small, consider using folders instead of
				repositories. If each repository contains a large set of data (more than 100 GB),
				using many repositories is not a problem.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Prevent getChildren Calls on Large Folders</div><div type="Prevent getChildren Calls on Large Folders">
			
			<p class="p">If folders contain many children, performance might be impaired when you navigate to one of
				these folders using a <span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">getChildren</span> call. If
				you navigate to a folder to analyze its data, for example, using the CMIS Workbench,
				this analysis becomes complicated. In contrast, fetching a child in a folder with
				many children by using its object ID or its path is not a problem.</p>

			<p class="p">It is difficult too define what qualifies as a "large" folder. If you send only one
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">getChildren</span> call per hour, then a
				thousand or more children would be totally acceptable, but if you send many calls
				per second, then even 100 children might impair performance. In any case, the load
				caused by calling this method increases linearly with the number of children.</p>

			<p class="p">Instead of having one folder with many children, you might consider subdividing the children
				into different subfolders or even a subfolder hierarchy. Another alternative to
				using the <span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">getChildren</span> call is to use the
				query method with the <span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">IN_FOLDER</span> predicate
				together with additional restrictions to limit the number of matching results.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Do Not Use Large Skip Counts</div><div type="Do Not Use Large Skip Counts">
			
			<p class="p">Several CMIS methods have a skip count parameter, for example, the
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">getChildren</span> or the
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">query</span> method. Using large skip counts
				produces a significant load because a huge number of matching result objects is
				found and skipped before the final result set can be collected. To prevent the need
				for large skip counts, try to reduce the number of matching results by subdividing
				the children into different subfolders or by using a more selective query.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Avoid Using a Sort Criterion (for example, getChildren, query)</div><div type="Avoid Using a Sort Criterion (for example, getChildren, query)">
			
			<p class="p">Only use a sort criterion if you really need it, because it might reduce performance
				significantly (see also <cite class="cite">Paging with maxItems and skipCount (for example, for
					getChildren, query)</cite> in the <cite class="cite">Frequently Asked Questions</cite>.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Do Not Request All Properties of an Object</div><div type="Do Not Request All Properties of an Object">
			
			<p class="p">In the operational context (see the
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">OperationalContext.java</span> class), you can
				define the properties that are to be returned together with the selected objects. Do
				not query all properties because this might be time consuming and it increases the
				amount of data transferred over the network. In particular, requesting the
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">cmis:path</span> property can be inefficient
				because it has to be computed for each call. The general rule is to reduce the
				amount of data you fetch from the document service;  this also applies to other
				information you might request together with the objects, such as the ACLs or allowed
				actions.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Access Using the Object ID Rather Than the Path</div><div type="Access Using the Object ID Rather Than the Path">
			
			<p class="p">It is much faster to access an object using its ID than using its path.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Prevent Use of getFolderTree, getDescendants, and IN_TREE on Large Hierarchies</div><div type="Prevent Use of getFolderTree, getDescendants, and IN_TREE on Large Hierarchies">
			
			<p class="p">Using the <span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">getFolderTree</span> or
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">getDescendants</span> method on large
				hierarchies is very inefficient. The same is true for the folder predicate
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">IN_TREE</span> that you can use in the
				statement of the query method. All these methods are slow for large hierarchies even
				if the final result set is small.</p>

			<p class="p">The reason for the performance problems with these methods is that all the descendant folders
				of the start folder have to be loaded from the database into the server where the
				document service is running. This results in many calls to the database and many
				objects are transferred over the network. Finally, a very complex query with all the
				IDs of the folders in the hierarchy has to be created and sent to the database to
				get the final result.</p>

			<p class="p">For the query method, the size of  the searchable folder hierarchy is already restricted to a
				maximum of 1000. For larger hierarchies an exception is thrown. Be aware that even a
				hierarchy of 1000 folders is quite large and results in a heavy load on the system
				as well as bad performance for the request. </p>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Reuse OpenCmis Session Objects</div><div type="Reuse OpenCmis Session Objects">
			
			<p class="p">When applications use the document service they fetch a session object using one of the
				connect methods. Creating a session is quite an expensive operation, which should be
				reused and shared if possible. A session object is thread safe and allows parallel
				method calls.</p>

			<p class="p">Usually, a session is bound to a user. To reduce the number of sessions that are created,
				fetch the session only for the first request of the user and store it in the user's
				HTTP session. Then the session can be reused in subsequent requests of this
				user.</p>

			<p class="p">If an application uses a service user to connect the session to the document service,
				we recommend that you store this session in a central place and reuse it for all
				subsequent requests.</p>

			<p class="p">When you share a session object, observe the following tips:</p>

			<div class="p">
				<ul class="ul" id="loio652ce63c3f0445bdae9456d9791982d6__ul_j24_q2f_pn"><li class="li">A session object has an internal cache, for example, for already fetched objects. To make
						sure that you fetch the latest version of specific objects, clear the cache
						from time to time.</li>
<li class="li">If a session is used for a very long time, problems might occur that result in exceptions
						(for example, network connection problems). A possible solution is to
						replace the failing session with a new one. However, do not replace a
						session if an <span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">ObjectNotFound</span>
						exception is thrown because you tried to fetch a non-existent document or
						folder. This also applies to similar situations where the exception is part
						of the normal method behavior.</li>
<li class="li">Do not use a single session object for a large number of requests because
						due to session stickiness all these requests are send to the same server.
						Rather use a pool of about 50 to 100 session objects to distribute the
						requests over different servers on which the document service is
						running.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Search Hints</div><div type="Search Hints">
			
			<div class="p">You can indicate hints for queries. The general syntax is:
				<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint ">hint:&lt;hintname&gt;[,&lt;hintname&gt;]*:&lt;cmis query&gt;</pre></div>
</div>

			<div class="p">The following hints are currently available:<ul class="ul" id="loio652ce63c3f0445bdae9456d9791982d6__ul_rhz_1c2_ts"><li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">ignoreOwner</samp>: Usually, documents are returned for which the
						current user is the owner OR is present in an ACE. The
							<samp class="ph codeph">ignoreOwner</samp> setting returns only documents for which
						the current user has an ACE; ownership is ignored in this case. This
						improves the speed of the query because the owner check is omitted. This is
						useful if the owner is present in an ACE anyway.</li>
<li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">noPath</samp>: Does not return the path property even if it is
						requested. This improves the speed of queries on folders, because paths do
						not have to be computed internally.</li>
