			<p class="p">The service treats user names as opaque strings that are defined by the application.
				All actions in the document service are executed in the context of this named user
				or the currently logged-in user. That is, the service sets the
					<span class="keyword parmname">cmis:createdBy</span> and <span class="keyword parmname">cmis:lastModifiedBy</span>
				properties to the provided user name. The service also uses this user name to
				evaluate access control lists (ACLs). For more information, see the CMIS
				specification. The document service is not connected to a user management system
				and, therefore, does not perform any user authentication.</p>

<div class="section" id="loio4d66976ef1b84aabbeb524fdc40af5d5__section_A565742B94FC470995EE6EF7C798F750"><div class="section_title">Repository Naming and Data Isolation</div><div type="Repository Naming and Data Isolation">
			
			<p class="p">Repositories are identified either by their unique name or by their ID. The unique
				name is a human-readable name that should be constructed with Java package-name
				semantics, for example,
					<span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">com.foo.MySpecialRepository</span>, to avoid
				name conflicts. Repositories in the document service are secured by a key provided
				by the application. When a repository is created, a key must be supplied. Any
				further attempts to connect to this repository only succeed if the key provided by
				the connecting application matches the key that was used to create the repository.
				Therefore this key must be stored in a secure manner. It is, however, up to the
				application to decide whether to share this key with other applications from the
				same account to implement data-sharing scenarios.</p>

			<p class="p">Multiple applications can access the same repository. However, applications can only
				connect to the same repository using the unique name assigned to this repository if
				they are deployed within the same account as the application that created the
				repository. In contrast, applications that are deployed in a different account
				cannot access this repository. A consequence of having repositories isolated within
				an account is that data cannot be shared across different accounts.</p>

			<p class="p">Repository ABC is created when Application<sub class="ph sub">1</sub> is deployed in
					Account<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>. Application<sub class="ph sub">2</sub> is located in the same
					Account<sub class="ph sub">1</sub> as Application<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>; therefore,
					Application<sub class="ph sub">2</sub> can also access the same repository using its unique
				name ABC. Application<sub class="ph sub">3</sub> is deployed in Account<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>.
					Application<sub class="ph sub">3</sub> calls a repository that has the same unique name ABC as
				the other repository that belongs to Account<sub class="ph sub">1</sub>. However,
					Application<sub class="ph sub">3</sub> cannot access the ABC repository that belongs to
					Account<sub class="ph sub">1</sub> using the identical unique name, because the repositories
				are isolated within the account. Therefore, Application<sub class="ph sub">3</sub> in
					Account<sub class="ph sub">2</sub> connects to another ABC repository that belongs to
					Account<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>. In summary, a repository can only be accessed by
				applications that are deployed in the same account as the application that created
				the repository.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Multitenancy</div><div type="Multitenancy">
			
			<p class="p">The document service supports multitenancy and isolates data between tenants. Each
				application consuming the document service creates a repository and provides a
				unique name and a secret key. The document service creates the repository internally
				in the context of the tenant using the application. While the repository name
				uniquely identifies the repository, an internal ID is created for the application
				for each tenant. This ID identifies the storage area containing all the data for the
				tenant in this repository. To access the content of the different tenant
				repositories, a destination for each tenant is required. The destination host name
				contains the tenant alias ecm-<var class="keyword varname">&lt;tenantAlias&gt;</var>…. If the tenant alias
				is, for example, <span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">development</span>, the host name
				starts with <span class="ph sap-technical-name sap-technical-name">ecm-development</span>….</p>
