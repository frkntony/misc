				check the status of the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>
				attached in the current account, if any. The view provides information about the
					<span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>
				ID, version, used Java runtime, high availability setup, and some more details.
				Access is granted to administrators, developers and support users.</p>

<p class="p">All requests that went through the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> to the
				respective back-ends as specified through access control take a certain amount of
				time. You can check the duration of requests in a bar chart. The bar chart either
				shows the duration statistics for all virtual hosts or for a selected virtual host.
				The requests are not shown individually, but are clustered (assigned to buckets).
				Each of these buckets represents a time range. </p>
<p class="p">For example, the first bucket
				contains all requests that took 10ms or less, the second one the requests that took
				longer than 10ms, but not longer than 20ms. The last bucket contains all requests
				that took longer than 5000ms. </p>
<div class="p">The collection of duration statistics starts as

<p class="p">The number of displayed requests is limited to 50. You can either view all

<p class="p">The maximum
				idle time is displayed on the rightmost side of the horizontal axis. For any point
