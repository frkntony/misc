	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Configuration of custom domains has different setups related to the subscriptions of
		your account. Subscriptions represent applications that your account has purchased for use
		from an application provider. </p>

		<p class="p">A subscription means that there is a contract between an application provider and a tenant that
			authorizes the tenant to use the provider's application. As the consumer account, you do
			not own, deploy, or operate these applications yourself. Subscriptions allow you to
			configure certain features of the applications and launch them through consumer-specific
			URLs.</p>

		<p class="p">The default URL of a multitenant application is:
				<span class="ph filepath">https://&lt;application_name&gt;&lt;provider_account&gt;-&lt;consumer_account&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;</span>.</p>

		<div class="p">When you configure custom domains for such applications that are part of a subscription, the
			following scenarios are possible:<ul class="ul" id="loiob2b5dcc4fd9842388bb047d2922be48c__ul_lwz_xly_qp">
				<li class="li">The custom domain is owned by the application provider who uses an SSL host from their
					account quota. The provider also does the configuration and assignment of the
					custom domain. The provider can assign a subdomain of its own custom domain to a
					particular subscription URL. To do this, the provider needs to have rights in
					both the provider and consumer account. </li>

				<li class="li">The customer (consumer) uses an SSL host from the consumer account quota. In this case, the
					customer (consumer) owns the custom domain and the SSL host and is therefore
					able do the necessary configuration on their own. </li>

			</ul>
