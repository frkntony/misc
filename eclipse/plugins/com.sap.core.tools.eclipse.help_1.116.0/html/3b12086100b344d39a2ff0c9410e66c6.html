		<p class="p">After installing a new <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> in a
			network, no systems or resources of the network have been exposed to the cloud yet. You
			have to configure each system and resource that shall be used by applications of the
			connected cloud account. To do this, choose <span class="ph uicontrol">Cloud To On Premise</span>
			from your account menu and go to tab <span class="ph uicontrol">Access Control</span>: </p>

		<p class="p">Thereby, any type of system that can be called via one of the supported protocols
			(currently: HTTP and RFC), i.e. both SAP and non-SAP systems are supported. As an
			example, a convenient way to access an ABAP system in a cloud application is to do this
			via <a class="xref" href="http://help.sap.com/nwgateway" target="_blank" alt="http://help.sap.com/nwgateway" title="http://help.sap.com/nwgateway">SAP
				NetWeaver Gateway</a>, as it allows consumption of ABAP content via HTTP and open
			standards. </p>

			<li class="li">Detailed documentation on how HTTP resources are configured can be found here: <a class="xref" href="e7d4927dbb571014af7ef6ebd6cc3511.html">Configuring Access Control (HTTP)</a></li>

			<li class="li">Detailed documentation on how RFC resources are configured can be found here: <a class="xref" href="ca5868997e48468395cf0ca4882f5783.html">Configuring Access Control (RFC)</a></li>

		</ul>

		<p class="p">We recommend that you narrow the access only to those backend services and resources that
			are explicitly needed by the cloud applications. Instead of configuring, for example, a
			system and granting access to all its resources, we recommend that you only grant access
			to the concrete resources which are needed by the cloud application. For example, define
			access to an HTTP service by specifying the service URL root path and allowing access to
			all its sub-paths.</p>

		<p class="p">When configuring an on-premise system, it is possible to define a virtual host and port
			for the specified system, as shown in the screenshot below. The virtual host name and
			port represent the fully-qualified domain name of the related system in the cloud. We
			recommend that you use the virtual host name/port mapping in order to prevent from
			leaking information about the physical machine name and port of an on-premise system and
			thus â€“ of your internal network infrastructure getting published to the cloud. </p>
