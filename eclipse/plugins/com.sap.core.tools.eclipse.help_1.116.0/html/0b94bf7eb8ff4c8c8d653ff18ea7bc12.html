	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Using YaaS together with <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> you develop business services that are
		consumed in your cloud applications.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Overview</div><div type="Overview">
			
			<p class="p">With YaaS you can develop business services, publish and sell them through the YaaS Market,
				and consume them in your cloud applications. The core design principle behind YaaS
				is a microservice architecture, which enables you to build a flexible and scalable
				platform. A microservice architecture is another method of bundling components into
				services. The approach is to develop a single application as a suite of small
				services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight
				mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business
				capabilities and are independently deployable by fully automated deployment
				machinery.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Business Services and Builder Modules</div><div type="Business Services and Builder Modules">
			
			<p class="p">In YaaS, you develop the following component types when providing new services or consuming
				existing ones:</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio0b94bf7eb8ff4c8c8d653ff18ea7bc12__ul_ipn_w5k_h5">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Business services</p>

					<p class="p">A business service is simply a microservice that provides a specific business functionality,
						such as products, loyalty, or orders. A set of business services is grouped
						into a package that gets published on the YaaS Market.</p>

					<p class="p">A business service is a Web application with a RESTful API that exposes the resources and
						functions of the service. The service implementation should follow the
						guidelines for microservices so that the service has a clearly defined
						scope, is highly scalable, resilient against failures, and self-contained.
						We recommend using the <a class="extlink" href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer?site=https://devportal.yaas.io/tools/servicesdk/index.html" target="_blank" alt="https://devportal.yaas.io/tools/servicesdk/index.html" title="https://devportal.yaas.io/tools/servicesdk/index.html">YaaS Service SDK<img src="../images/3rd_link.png" class="link-external" alt="Information published on non-SAP site" title="Information published on non-SAP site" border="0"/></a> to create new business
						services, as it provides a lightweight framework that helps with the API
						definition and implementation of the service. The SDK uses RAML (RESTful API
						Modeling Language) as an API modeling language and provides code generators
						to create the JAX-RS compliant Java API classes and Java implementation
						stubs. It further provides helper classes to get, for example, the YaaS
						tenant and other YaaS relevant information that is propagated from YaaS to
						the business service.</p>

					<p class="p">Builder modules </p>

					<p class="p">A builder module is a user interface in the YaaS Builder application, in which the
						backoffice functionality of a business service is managed; for example, an
						administration UI for a service published in YaaS.</p>

					<p class="p">Builder modules are the backoffice clients of YaaS. They allow users to manage the service
						data from the user interface. Typically, a builder module is an HTML5
						application calling the service APIs. As such, it is very easy to deploy it
						as a Java Web Tomcat 7 application on <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>: create a
						builder module according to the tutorial on <a class="extlink" href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer?site=https://devportal.yaas.io/gettingstarted/createabuildermodule/index.html" target="_blank" alt="https://devportal.yaas.io/gettingstarted/createabuildermodule/index.html" title="https://devportal.yaas.io/gettingstarted/createabuildermodule/index.html">YaaS Dev Portal<img src="../images/3rd_link.png" class="link-external" alt="Information published on non-SAP site" title="Information published on non-SAP site" border="0"/></a>, add Cross-origin resource
						sharing (CORS) configuration to the <samp class="ph codeph">web.xml</samp>, and build a
						WAR file.</p>

					<p class="p">Applications</p>

					<p class="p">An application is able to consume the business services to which it is subscribed.
						Subscribing to existing packages is possible via the YaaS Market.</p>

								<p class="p">As a <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">User</span>, you need an account and have to be part of an
									Organization. Within the <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Organization</span>,
									there are Dev Teams and Projects. In the <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Dev
										Teams</span> you develop services and builder modules.
									In the <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Projects</span>, you consume these
									services.</p>

								<p class="p">When you are member of a Project, you can manage projects and
									subscribe to packages.</p>

								<p class="p">The <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Package</span> stands in the middle of the
									whole picture. It connects the YaaS components, the Yaas Market
									and the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> components. All available
									published packages are listed in the <a class="extlink" href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer?site=https://market.yaas.io/commercial/" target="_blank" alt="https://market.yaas.io/commercial/" title="https://market.yaas.io/commercial/">YaaS Market<img src="../images/3rd_link.png" class="link-external" alt="Information published on non-SAP site" title="Information published on non-SAP site" border="0"/></a>.</p>

								<p class="p">The <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Services</span> are the building blocks of YaaS. They are small,
									isolated applications that are responsible for one single piece
									of functionality.</p>

								<p class="p">The <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Service SDK</span> is a tool that facilitates
									the development of the business services. It also provides some
									YaaS-specific utilities, for example, retrieving the tenant ID
									propagated by an application to the used business services.</p>

								<p class="p">After creating a service, you create a <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Builder
										Module</span> for that service. This enables you to have
									a user interface (UI) to manage your service from a business
									perspective. </p>

								<p class="p">The <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Builder SDK</span> helps you create this UI.
									This is a command-line interface that runs the Builder in
									developer mode. This mode implements a builder module faster and
									more efficiently.</p>
