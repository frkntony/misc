		<p class="p">Usually, a customer network is divided into multiple network zones or sub-networks according to
			the security level of the contained components. There is, for instance, the DMZ that
			contains and exposes the external-facing services of an organization to an untrusted
			network, usually the Internet, and there is one or multiple other network zones which
			contain the components and services provided in the companyâ€™s intranet. </p>

		<p class="p">Generally, customers have the choice in which network zone the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> should be
			set-up in their network. Technical prerequisites for the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> to work
			properly are: </p>

		<ul class="ul" id="loio7b9d90cb3049445c9b4454c6c044cc62__ul_ubx_wbw_rn">
			<li class="li"><span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> must have
				internet access to the <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> landscape
				host, either directly or via HTTPS proxy.</li>

			<li class="li"><span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> must have
				direct access to the internal systems it shall provide access to. That means, there
				must be transparent connectivity between the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> and the
				internal system. </li>

		</ul>

		<p class="p">Depending on the needs of the project, the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> can be
			either set-up in the DMZ and operated centrally by the IT department or set-up in the
			intranet and operated by the line-of-business.</p>

		<div class="p">
			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> The internal network must allow access to the port. Specific configuration for opening the
				respective port(s) depends on the firewall software used. <p class="p"/>
The default ports are
					<kbd class="ph userinput">80</kbd> for HTTP and <kbd class="ph userinput">443</kbd> for HTTPS. For
				RFC communication, you need to open a gateway port (default:
					<kbd class="ph userinput">33+&lt;instance number&gt;</kbd> and an arbitrary message
				server port. For a connection to a HANA Database (on <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>) via JDBC,
				you need to open an arbitrary <em class="ph i">outbound</em> port in your network. Mail (SMTP)
				communication is not supported.<p class="p"/>
