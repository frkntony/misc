				<li class="li"><kbd class="ph userinput">Application Provider</kbd> - an organizational unit that uses
					<span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> to build, run and sell applications to customers, that
					is, the application consumers.</li>

				<li class="li"><kbd class="ph userinput">Application Consumer</kbd> - an organizational unit, typically a customer
					or a department inside a customerâ€™s organization, which uses an <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> application for a certain purpose. Obviously, the application is in
					fact used by end users, who might be employees of the organization (for
					instance, in the case of an HR application) or just arbitrary users, internal or
					external (for instance, in the case of a collaborative supplier
					application).</li>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Accounts and Account Members</div><div type="Accounts and Account Members">
			
			<p class="p">To use <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>, both the application provider and the application consumer
				need to have an account. The account is the central organizational unit in SAP HANA
				Cloud Plaftorm. It is the central entry point to <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> for both
				application providers and consumers. It may consist of a set of applications, a set
				of account members and an account-specific configuration. </p>

			<p class="p">Account members are users who must be registered via the SAP ID service. Account members may
				have different privileges regarding the operations which are possible for an account
				(for example, account administration, deploy/start/stop applications). Note that the
				account belongs to an organization and not to an individual. Nevertheless, the
				interaction with the account is performed by individuals, the members of the
				account. The account-specific configuration allows application providers and
				application consumers to adapt their account to their specific environment and
				needs. </p>

			<p class="p">An application resides in exactly one account, the hosting account. It is uniquely identified
				by the account name and the application name. Applications consume <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> resources, for instance, compute units, structured and unstructured storage
				and outgoing bandwidth. Costs for consumed resources are billed to the owner of the
				hosting account, who can be an application provider, an application consumer, or
				both.</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio48b552fa449945b9afc7885e1919ce2b__ul_dt1_k5v_bm">
				<li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Consumer-Managed Application Model</span><p class="p">In the consumer-managed
						application model, a copy of the application is deployed into the consumer
						account. The application consumer buys the application from the application
						provider via SAP Store. In addition, the application consumer separately
						buys all required <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> resources (such as compute units,
						storage or bandwidth) from the platform provider, that is SAP. All platform
						resources consumed by the application are directly billed to the application
						consumer. The compute units hosting the application are not shared between
						multiple application consumers. Instead, each application consumer runs the
						application on dedicated compute units (VMs). In the consumer-managed
						application model, the application consumer is responsible to operate the
						application.</p>
</li>

				<li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Provider-Managed Application Model</span><p class="p">In the provider-managed
						application model, the application is deployed into the provider account
						only. The application provider may decide to start a dedicated compute unit
						for each consumer or to share one or multiple compute units between them.
						The application is operated and maintained by the application provider.
						Platform resources consumed by the application are billed to the application
						provider. The application provider is responsible for passing the costs on
						to the consumers. Application providers can define their own price model,
						which can be independent from the platform resources prices. </p>
<p class="p">In the
						provider-managed deployment model, there is no deployment required into the
						consumer account. Instead, consumers are "subscribed" to the provider
						application, once they have purchased the application. As a result, a
						subscription for the purchased application is created in the consumer
						account. This subscription enables consumers to launch the application,
						using a consumer specific URL, and configure it to their needs.
						</p>
<p class="p">Typically, the application consumer configures the used identity
						provider, the user roles for the application, or, if required by the
						subscribed application, the connection parameters to another
					system.</p>
