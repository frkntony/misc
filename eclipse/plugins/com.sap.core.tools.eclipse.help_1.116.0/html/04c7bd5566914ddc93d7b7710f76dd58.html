	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">This page provides sizing information for applications using the Remote Data Sync
		service. </p>

		<p class="p">Although the only realistic answers to optimal resource planning are “It depends” and “Testing
			will show what you need”, this section aims to help you choose the right hardware
			parameters. </p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Synchronization Phases</div><div type="Synchronization Phases">
			
			<p class="p">The figure below shows the major phases of a synchronization session. Though not
				complete, it covers many common use cases.</p>

			<ol class="ol" id="loio04c7bd5566914ddc93d7b7710f76dd58__ol_rhr_21d_4s">
				<li class="li">Synchronization is initiated by a remote database client. It uploads any changes
					made at the remote database to the server. </li>

				<li class="li">MobiLink applies the changes to the database. </li>

				<li class="li">MobiLink queries the database and prepares the changes to be sent to the remote
					database client. </li>

				<li class="li">MobiLink sends the changes to the remote database client. </li>

			</ol>

			<p class="p"><img class="image" id="loio04c7bd5566914ddc93d7b7710f76dd58__image_bkw_51d_4s" src="loio91b5fc2a847047e8bae8ed94439f2f68_HiRes.png"/></p>

			<p class="p">Roughly, the MobiLink server uses two thread pools – one for database connections,
				and one for the network side. These can be controlled by command-line options,
				although, by default, the Remote Data Sync service dynamically tunes the size of the
				worker thread pool to accommodate load changes. </p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Database Capacity</div><div type="Database Capacity">
			
			<p class="p">When the Remote Data Sync server applies changes to the consolidated database and
				prepares changes to be sent to the remote database client, it typically does so by
				executing SQL statements or stored procedures that are invoked by MobiLink events.
				For example, to apply an upload MobiLink may execute insert, update, and delete
				statements for each table being synchronized; to prepare a download MobiLink may
				execute a query for each table being synchronized. </p>

			<p class="p">Database tuning is outside the scope of this document, but the load on the database can be
				substantial. Think of MobiLink as a concentrator of database load. All the
				operations that are carried out against the remote database while disconnected, in
				addition to the requests for updates to be downloaded to the remote database, are
				executed in two transactions (1 upload, 1 download) against the consolidated
				database. This can place a heavy load on the database. </p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Maximum Number of Concurrent Synchronizations</div><div type="Maximum Number of Concurrent Synchronizations">
			
			<p class="p">You should know the number of concurrent synchronizations as a starting point, and from there
				on, calculate back on the required resources. Typically, this number is limited by
				RAM requirements. To estimate, you need a typical upload and download data volume as
				a starting point. </p>

			<p class="p">A machine with <kbd class="ph userinput">N</kbd> MB of RAM can have <kbd class="ph userinput">C</kbd>
				clients each with about <kbd class="ph userinput">V</kbd> MB of upload or download data
				volume, where <kbd class="ph userinput">C = N/V</kbd>. </p>

			<p class="p">Following this formula, for large synchronizations (&lt; 20 MB), you can have: </p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio04c7bd5566914ddc93d7b7710f76dd58__ul_pnr_14g_ks">
				<li class="li"><span class="keyword cmdname">Remote Data Sync service, Standard</span>: C = 4096/20 → C @ 200 simultaneous
					syncs </li>

				<li class="li"><span class="keyword cmdname">Remote Data Sync service, Premium</span>: C = 8192/20 → C @ 400 simultaneous
					syncs </li>

			</ul>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Maximum Sustainable Throughput</div><div type="Maximum Sustainable Throughput">
			
			<p class="p">The rate limiting steps of a synchronization are commonly: </p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loio04c7bd5566914ddc93d7b7710f76dd58__ul_v2d_g4g_ks">
				<li class="li">Data transfer, in the case of slow networks </li>

				<li class="li">Database operations, especially in the case of complex schemas and complex
					synchronization logic.</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">Remote Data Sync servers are not typically CPU intensive, and typically require less
				than half the processing that is required by the consolidated database. When
				selecting the appropriate compute units for MobiLink, memory is more likely to limit
				the maximum sustainable throughput for a Remote Data Sync server than CPU.</p>

			<p class="p"><span class="ph emphasis emphasis">Example:</span></p>

			<ol class="ol" id="loio04c7bd5566914ddc93d7b7710f76dd58__ol_fpw_m4g_ks">
				<li class="li">Let's assume the database can process the target load of
						<kbd class="ph userinput">L</kbd> synchronizations per second (and that is a matter
					for testing). </li>

				<li class="li">At this throughput, one database thread will come open every <kbd class="ph userinput">1/L</kbd>
					seconds. To keep throughput high, a synchronization request should be ready,
					with data uploaded and available to pass to the database thread. </li>

				<li class="li">To keep the database busy, if a synchronization request takes <kbd class="ph userinput">t</kbd>
					seconds to upload (which will depend on network speed and data volume, and which
					should be determined by testing), then the Remote Data Sync server must be able
					to hold (<kbd class="ph userinput">L</kbd> x <kbd class="ph userinput">t</kbd>) client data
					uploads in memory. </li>

				<li class="li">The Remote Data Sync server must also be able to download the data to the client to prevent
					the database threads having to wait for a network connection to download. In the
					case, this volume is similar to the uploads we end up with: MobiLink should be
					able to support (<kbd class="ph userinput">2</kbd> x <kbd class="ph userinput">L</kbd> x
						<kbd class="ph userinput">t</kbd>) simultaneous synchronizations to maintain a
					throughput of <kbd class="ph userinput">L</kbd> synchronizations per second.</li>

			</ol>

			<p class="p"/>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span> 
				<p class="p">For example, to support a peak sustained throughput of <kbd class="ph userinput">50</kbd>
					synchronizations per second, with a client that takes <kbd class="ph userinput">0.5</kbd>
					seconds to upload and download data, then the Remote Data Sync server should be
					able to support <kbd class="ph userinput">50</kbd> simultaneous synchronizations in RAM
					to sustain this rate as a peak throughput. Assuming data transfer volumes per
					client are less than <kbd class="ph userinput">80</kbd> MB (which is a very high number
					for data synchronization), a <span class="keyword cmdname">Standard</span> machine would be a good
					choice to start with.</p>
