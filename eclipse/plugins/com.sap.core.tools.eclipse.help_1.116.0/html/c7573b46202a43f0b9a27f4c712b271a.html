		<div class="p">The <span class="ph pname">gamification service</span>
			rule engine allows the use of two event streams:<ul class="ul" id="loioc7573b46202a43f0b9a27f4c712b271a__ul_blf_f2t_4t">
				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Managed event stream - <span class="keyword cmdname">eventstream</span>: All events and user
						actions that are sent using the API will automatically be sent using the
						managed event stream. “Managed” means that all events are retracted
						automatically. Point-in-time events (duration=0) are retracted immediately
						after execution of the corresponding rules while long-living events
						(duration &gt;0) are retracted 1 second after they have expired. If this
						automated event retraction is not suitable for your use case, you can use
						the unmanaged stream instead.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">
					<p class="p">Unmanaged event stream - <span class="keyword cmdname">unmanagedstream</span>: For this stream you must take
						care of event retraction yourself, which offers more flexibility with
						regards to rule design. For stability reasons, events sent to this stream
						are retracted automatically after 28 days.</p>

				</li>

			</ul>
</div>

		<p class="p">You must explicitly declare in the trigger part which event stream will be used. Furthermore,
			you must explicitly declare in the consequences part which event stream is used in case
			you create new events. Using the managed stream is strongly recommended. Only use the
			unmanaged stream if the auto-retraction does not work with your rule design. </p>
