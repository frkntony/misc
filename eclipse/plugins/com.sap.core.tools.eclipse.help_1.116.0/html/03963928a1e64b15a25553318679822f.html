		<p class="p">Performance statistics are disabled by default, and you need to enable them to start gathering
			data. In the cockpit, the <span class="ph uicontrol">Performance Statistics</span> tab of a started
			application allows you to enable the collection of performance statistics data. To view
			the collected performance statistics data, you have to generate a report.</p>

		<p class="p">Each report provides a breakdown of the time and resources such as CPU, memory and so on, used
			by the different services of the platform for each HTTP request to your application. You
			can get insight on specific requests and the respective behavior of your application.
			Currently, the supported services are the platform runtime and the persistence
			service.</p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note</span>
