			<p class="p">This section outlines an alternative approach for technical connectivity between the cloud and
				on-premise, using a reverse proxy. It also discusses the pros and cons of this
				method compared to when you use the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>.</p>

			<p class="p">An alternative approach compared to the SSL VPN solution that is provided by the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> is to
				expose on-premise services and applications via a reverse proxy to the Internet. For
				this method, there is typically a reverse proxy setup in the "demilitarized zone"
				(DMZ) subnetwork of a customer, which: </p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loiodde01af51ddc49758dbbb03afcb075e5__ul_rb3_xch_gk">
				<li class="li">Acts as a mediator between <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> and the
					on-premise services; </li>

				<li class="li">Provides the services of an Application Delivery Controller (ADC) in order, for
					example, to encrypt, filter, route, or introspect the inbound traffic. </li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">The figure below shows the minimal overall network topology of this approach. For
				more information, see <a class="extlink" href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer?site=https://websmp201.sap-ag.de/%7Esapidb/011000358700000723732012E/SAP_OD_TCG_FINAL_V12.pdf" target="_blank" download="" alt="https://websmp201.sap-ag.de/%7Esapidb/011000358700000723732012E/SAP_OD_TCG_FINAL_V12.pdf" title="https://websmp201.sap-ag.de/%7Esapidb/011000358700000723732012E/SAP_OD_TCG_FINAL_V12.pdf">Technical Connectivity Guide<img src="../images/sap_link.png" class="link-sap" alt="Information published on SAP site" title="Information published on SAP site" border="0"/></a>. </p>

			<p class="p">On-premise services accessible via a reverse proxy are then callable from <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> like other
				HTTP services available on the Internet. When you use destinations to call those
				services, make sure that the configuration of the <span class="keyword parmname">ProxyType</span>
				parameter is set to <kbd class="ph userinput">Internet</kbd>.</p>

			<p class="p">Depending on your scenario, you can benefit from the reverse proxy. An example is the required
				network infrastructure (such as a reverse proxy and ADC services): since it already
				exists in your network landscape, you can reuse it to connect to <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>. In this
				case, there would be no need to set up and operate new components on your (customer)
				side.</p>

			<ul class="ul" id="loiodde01af51ddc49758dbbb03afcb075e5__ul_i5f_5ch_gk">
				<li class="li">The reverse proxy approach does not prevent the exposed services from being
					generally accessible via the Internet, which makes them vulnerable to attacks
					from anywhere in the world. <span class="ph uicontrol">Denial-of-Service</span> attacks in
					particular are possible and difficult to protect against. Therefore, protection
					against potential attacks requires the highest security standards to be
					implemented in the DMZ and reverse proxy. For the productive deployment of a
					hybrid cloud/on-premise application, this approach usually requires intense
					involvement of the customer's IT department and a longer period of
					implementation.</li>

				<li class="li">If the reverse proxy is set to allow filtering or restriction of accepted source IP
					addresses, you can only set one single IP address to be used for all <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> outbound
					communications. <p class="p">Although it filters any callers that are not running on the
						cloud, the reverse proxy does not exclusively restrict the access to cloud
						applications belonging to the related customer. Basically, any application
						running on the cloud would pass this filter.</p>
</li>

				<li class="li">SAP-proprietary RFC protocol is not supported, so that a cloud application
					cannot directly call an on-premise ABAP system without having application
					proxies on top of ABAP.</li>

				establishes the SSL VPN tunnel to <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> via a reverse
				invoke approach, there is no need to configure the DMZ or external firewall of a
				customer network for inbound traffic. Attacks from the Internet are not possible.
				With its simple setup and fine-grained access control of exposed systems and
				resources, the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> allows
				a high level of security and fast productive implementation of hybrid applications.
				It also supports multiple application protocols such as <span class="ph uicontrol">HTTP</span>
				and <span class="ph uicontrol">RFC</span>.</div>
