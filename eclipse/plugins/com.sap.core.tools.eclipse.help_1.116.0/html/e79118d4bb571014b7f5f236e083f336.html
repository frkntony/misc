How much data can I lose in the worst case?</div><div type="How often does a backup occur? How much data can I lose in the worst case?">
			
			<p class="p">For productive databases, a full data backup is done once a day. Log backup is
				triggered at least every 30 minutes. The corresponding data or log backups are
				replicated to a secondary location every two hours. Backups are kept (complete data
				and log) on a primary location for the last two backups and on a secondary location
				for the last 14 days. Backups are deleted afterwards. Recovery is therefore only
				possible within a time frame of 14 days. Restoring the system from files on a
				secondary location might take some time depending on the availability. For more
				information, see <a class="xref" href="fc379ef5efaf493cb619806f8a315cd5.html" title="If your database system is corrupt, you can perform a point-in-time restore by creating a service request in the cockpit.">Restoring Database Systems</a> and <a class="xref" href="f4ad65ddc06444a3a3641b2da2767a96.html" title="If your database is corrupt, you can perform a point-in-time restore by creating a service request in the cockpit.">Restoring Databases</a>. </p>

			<p class="p">SAP offers to back up and recover shared and dedicated database systems only as a
				whole.</p>

			<p class="p">For new database offerings such as SAP ASE and SAP HANA databases with multitenant
				database container (MDC) support (beta), you can operate several databases in the
				same database system and recover them individually. Thus, when binding applications
				to databases, you can achieve a fine grained control of the backup and recovery.</p>

			<p class="p">Due to the EclipsLink <a class="extlink" href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer?site=https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=317597" target="_blank" alt="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=317597" title="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=317597">bug

				column is created in the database. To enforce the creation of a CLOB column, you
				have to additionally specify @Column(length=4001) for the property concerned. In
				fact, any value may be chosen as long as it is at least 4001 for SAP MaxDB or 2001
				for the SAP HANA database. </p>

			<p class="p">Different database systems use different system tables and reserved words. As an
				application developer, make sure that the application does not use any of these
				reserved words for its own table and column names. </p>

			<div class="p">JPA does also not shield the application from this. If, for example, your entity
				class contains an attribute named "date", this will clash with the reserved word
				DATE on SAP MaxDB and cause schema creation to fail upon deployment. In such a case,
				the attribute should either be renamed to something else, or be mapped to another
				column name in the database. This can be done using the @Column annotation like
				this: <div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint">@Column(name="THEDATE")
private String date;
</pre></div>
