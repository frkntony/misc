<p dir="ltr" class="p">In the previous part "Preparing", we examined the general characteristics and

			<p class="p">The app is made up of a number of moving parts, which are shown in this diagram:</p>

			<p class="p">Let's have a quick tour of how the app is put together, visiting each file in turn.
			</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Index, Component and Message Bundle</div><div type="Index, Component and Message Bundle">
			
			<p class="p">In the beginning the browser loads the web application's
					<span class="ph filepath">index.html</span> which contains only minimal code. It loads the
				<span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> toolkit core using the standard variant bootstrap script tag, and there is a
				single function call to instantiate an
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.ComponentContainer</samp> and place it in the body of the
				HTML document. The <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.ComponentContainer</samp> loads an
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.UIComponent</samp> which is the self-contained
				encapsulation of the whole application. </p>

			<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.UIComponent</samp> (henceforth referred to as the
					'<dfn class="term">Component</dfn>') is defined in the <span class="ph filepath">Component.js</span>
				file in the same folder as <span class="ph filepath">index.html</span>; it is found through the
				specification of resource locations in the bootstrap tag - see the Bootstrap section
				for more details. The Component has metadata defined, which includes
				application-level configuration and routing information. Routing is the key best
				practice navigation mechanism and for non-trivial apps supersedes
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.EventBus</samp>-based navigation, and even
				shared-controller-based access to the top-level navigation control (such as an
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.NavContainer</samp>). </p>

			<p class="p">In the initialization part of the Component, models are created and set on the component: the
				main model that connects to the OData source, and some helper models for
				internationalization (i18n), where the texts are loaded from a local resource
					<samp class="ph codeph">messageBundle.properties</samp>, and device detection based
				arrangement of user interface (UI) controls. Further, the initialization of the
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.routing.Router</samp> (the Router) is performed. In the
				main section of the Component the root view ('<dfn class="term">App</dfn>') is instantiated.
				Like all the other views in this sample app, the root view is an XML view. </p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">The Views and Fragments</div><div type="The Views and Fragments">
			
			<p dir="ltr" class="p">The root view <dfn class="term">App</dfn>, defined in <span class="ph filepath">App.view.xml</span>, is
				very simple and contains a single <samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.SplitApp</samp> control. Neither
				the master nor the detail pages aggregations are filled at this time in the view
				definition; this is all managed by the Router, which is also the reason why there's
				no explicit requirement for a controller connected to this view.</p>

			<p dir="ltr" class="p">The visible part of the sample app is provided by three main XML views and a
				fragment. When displayed on devices other than a smartphone, there are two views
				shown - the master and the detail. Initially this is the
					<span class="ph filepath">Master.view.xml</span> and the
					<span class="ph filepath">Detail.view.xml</span> . Each of these views contain an
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.m.Page</samp>. There's also
				<span class="ph filepath">NotFound.view.xml</span>, to be used when no view can be matched to
				the resource requested. There is also the AddProduct view
					(<span class="ph filepath">AddProduct.view.xml</span>) which is shown in the detail pages
				aggregation when the <span class="ph uicontrol">add product</span> button is pressed. There are
				no direct dependencies between views. </p>

			<p dir="ltr" class="p">In the Detail view there is a couple of
					<samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.layout.form.SimpleForm</samp> controls to display the supplier
				address and category details. These controls are defined separately in XML fragments
					<span class="ph filepath">SupplierAddressForm.fragment.xml</span> and
					<span class="ph filepath">CategoryInfoForm.fragment.xml</span>. They are included in the
				Detail view using the <samp class="ph codeph">sap.ui.core.Fragment</samp> element. Finally,
				there's another fragment <span class="ph filepath">NameRequiredDialog.fragment.xml</span>, where
				a Dialog control is defined, to be shown if no name is specified in the new product
				form.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Other Files</div><div type="Other Files">
			
			<p dir="ltr" class="p">The <span class="ph filepath">Formatter.js</span> file contains formatting utilities
				that are used in various controls within the Master and Detail views. </p>

			<p dir="ltr" class="p">The css folder contains <span class="ph filepath">style.css</span> which has a very
				small amount of custom CSS, specifically to position the "not found" message further
				down that it would normally sit.</p>

		</div></div>
<div class="section"><div class="section_title">The Overall Folder Structure</div><div type="The Overall Folder Structure">
			
			<p class="p">The folder structure containing all the resources mentioned in this overview looks
				like this:</p>
