<h1 class="title topictitle1">Java Virtual Machine</h1>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p"><span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> infrastructure runs on SAP's own implementation of a Java Virtual
			Machine - SAP Java Virtual Machine (JVM). </p>
<p class="p">SAP JVM is a fully certified Java Standard Edition Virtual Machine for Java 7. It is derived from
			Oracle’s HotSpot VM and JDK implementation, but enhanced with several supportability
			features such as the SAP JVM Profiler for better monitoring, and profiling applications
			running on the <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA Cloud</span> local runtime. Customer support is provided
			directly by SAP for the full maintenance period of SAP applications that use the SAP
			JVM. </p>
<div class="section" id="loioda030d10d97610149defa1084cb0b2f1__section_B81F8E8CBFA642E8A33E1B7D2A0FF3F3"><div class="section_title">SAP JVM</div><div type="SAP JVM"> 
		 
		<p class="p">The SAP JVM is a standard compliant certified JDK,
		  supplemented by additional supportability and developer features and extensive
		  monitoring and tracing information. All these features are designed as
		  interactive, on-demand facilities of the JVM with minimal performance impact.
		  They can be switched on and off without having to restart the JVM (or the
		  application server that uses the JVM).

		<p class="p">With SAP JVM debugging on demand, Java developers
		  can activate and deactivate Java debugging directly – there is no need to start
		  the SAP JVM (or the application server on top of it) in a special mode. Java
		  debugging in the SAP JVM can be activated and deactivated using the
		  <span class="keyword uilabel">jvmmon tool</span>, which is
		  part of the SAP JVM delivery. This feature does not lower performance if
		  debugging is turned off. The SAP JVM JDK is delivered with full source code
		  providing debugging information, making Java debugging even more convenient. 
		</p>

<div class="section" id="loioda030d10d97610149defa1084cb0b2f1__section_0E69FD1DFC324767909F6FD921D3610B"><div class="section_title">Profiling</div><div type="Profiling"> 
		 
		<p class="p">To address the root cause of all performance and
		  memory problems, the SAP JVM comes with the SAP JVM Profiler, a powerful tool
		  that supports the developer in identifying runtime bottlenecks and reducing the
		  memory footprint. Profiling can be enabled on-demand without VM configuration
		  changes and works reliably even for very large Java applications. 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p">The user interface – the SAP JVM Profiler – can be
		  easily integrated into any Eclipse-based environment by using the established
		  plugin installation system of the Eclipse platform. It allows you to connect to
		  a running SAP JVM and analyze collected profiling data in a graphical manner.
		  The profiler plug-in provides a new perspective similar to the debug and Java
		  perspective. 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p">A number of profiling traces can be enabled or
		  disabled at any point in time, resulting in snapshots of profiling information
		  for the exact points of interest. The SAP JVM Profiler helps with the analysis
		  of this information and provides views of the collected data with comprehensive
		  filtering and navigation facilities. 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p">The profiling traces provided address the following
		  use cases: 
		</p>
 
		<ul class="ul"><li class="li">
			 Memory Allocation Analysis – investigates the memory consumption of your Java
			 application and finds allocation hotspots 
		  </li>
<li class="li">
			 Performance Analysis – investigates the runtime performance of your application
			 and finds expensive Java methods 
		  </li>
<li class="li">
			 Network Trace - analyzes the network traffic 
		  </li>
<li class="li"> File
			 I/O Trace - provides information about file operations 
		  </li>
<li class="li">
			 Synchronization Trace - detects sychronization issues within your application 
		  </li>
<li class="li">
			 Method Parameter Trace – yields detailed information about individual method
			 calls including parameter values and invocation counts 
		  </li>
<li class="li">
			 Profiling Lifecycle Information – a lightweight monitoring trace for memory
			 consumption, CPU load, and GC events. 
		  </li>
</ul>

		<p class="p">The SAP JVM provides comprehensive statistics about threads, memory consumption, garbage
				collection, and I/O activities. For solving issues with SAP JVM, a number of traces
				may be enabled on demand. They provide additional information and insight into
				integral VM parts such as the class loading system, the garbage collection
				algorithms, and I/O. The traces in the SAP JVM can be switched on and off using the
					<span class="ph uicontrol">jvmmon tool</span>, which is part of the SAP JVM delivery. </p>

 Thread dumps not

			consumed CPU and memory resources, I/O activities, and a description of communication
