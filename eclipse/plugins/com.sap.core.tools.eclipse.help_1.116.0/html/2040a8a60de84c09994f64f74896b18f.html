	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Each application deployed on <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> can be assigned one
		or more database schemas. A schema is associated with a particular account and is available
		solely to applications within this account. A schema can be bound to multiple
		applications.</p>

		<p class="p">In a typical life cycle, a schema is created, bound, unbound, and deleted.</p>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Creation</div><div type="Creation">
			
			<p class="p">You can create schemas explicitly with a freely definable name and assign them
				certain properties, such as a specific database type. The schema is independent of
				any application and has to be explicitly bound. </p>

			<p class="p">Schemas can also be created automatically for applications. If you have not explicitly bound a
				schema to an application when it is deployed and started for the first time, a
				schema is created and bound implicitly. This is the fallback behavior on <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>. </p>

			<p class="p">Note that a schema ID is unique within an account. When a schema is created
				automatically, an ID is also created based on a combination of the account and
				application names and the suffix <span class="ph filepath">web</span>. </p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Binding</div><div type="Binding">
			
			<p class="p">Schemas can be bound to applications based on an explicitly named data source or
				using the default data source. The main differences are as follows: </p>

			<div class="p">
				<ul class="ul" id="loio2040a8a60de84c09994f64f74896b18f__ul_opm_jxr_tk">
					<li class="li">Explicitly named data source<p class="p">When you bind the schema to an application,
							you specify a data source name. This establishes a named binding between
							the schema and application and allows the schema to be addressed by the
							application. The data source name is equivalent to the name used for the
							JNDI lookup. </p>
<p class="p">Named bindings allow an application to be bound to
							more than one schema and, in turn, to use more than one database at the
							same time. The databases can be distinguished by the binding
						names.</p>
</li>

					<li class="li">Default data source<p class="p">The schema is bound to the application without an
							explicitly specified data source name and is consequently associated
							with the default data source. It can be addressed by the application by
							any name. An application bound to the default data source cannot be
							bound to any additional schemas. This applies when a schema was
							automatically created and bound. </p>
<p class="p">The use of the default data
							source is a convenient option for applications that require only one
							database. </p>
</li>

				</ul>

			</div>

			<p class="p">You can share a schema between applications by binding the same schema to more than
				one application. Bear in mind the following when binding schemas to
				applications:</p>

			<div class="p">
				<ul class="ul" id="loio2040a8a60de84c09994f64f74896b18f__ul_unp_txr_tk">
					<li class="li">An application’s bindings are based on either named data sources or the
						default data source. An application cannot use a combination of the two
						types of bindings. </li>

					<li class="li">When named data sources are used, binding names must be unique per
						application.</li>

				</ul>

			</div>

			<p class="p">In the overview below, applications 1 and 2 have been explicitly bound to the
				associated schemas, while application 3 uses a schema that was automatically created
				and bound:</p>

			<p class="p">Note that applications can also use schemas belonging to other accounts if they are
				explicitly granted access permission.</p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Unbinding</div><div type="Unbinding">
			
			<p class="p">Unbind a schema from an application if the application no longer needs it. It can
				still be used by other applications to which it is still bound. Before a schema can
				be deleted, it has to be unbound from all applications. Schemas can only be deleted
				if they no longer have any bindings.</p>

			<p class="p">If an application is undeployed but was not unbound from the schema beforehand, the
				schema will still be listed as bound to the application and will therefore still be
				bound if the application is redeployed. </p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">Deletion</div><div type="Deletion">
			
			<p class="p">You should drop a schema when it is no longer required or if you want to redeploy an
				application from scratch. </p>

			<p class="p">Before deleting a schema, you should explicitly remove any bindings that still exist
				between the schema and an application. You can also remove all bindings by enforcing
				the deletion of the schema. </p>

		</div></div>

		<div class="section"><div class="section_title">JNDI Lookup</div><div type="JNDI Lookup">
			
			<p class="p"> When using explicitly named data sources to create bindings between schemas and applications,
				make sure that the data source names are the same as the JNDI names used in the
				applications.</p>

			<p class="p">Data sources are defined as resources in the <span class="ph filepath">web.xml</span> file, or as
				JTA or non-JTA data sources in the <span class="ph filepath">persistence.xml</span> file in the
