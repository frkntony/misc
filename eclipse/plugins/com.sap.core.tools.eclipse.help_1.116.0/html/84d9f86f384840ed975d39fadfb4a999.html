	<h1 class="title topictitle1">Integration Architecture Overview</h1>

	<div class="body conbody">
		<p class="p">The graphic below illustrates how a gamified application (gamified app) running on <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> is typically
			integrated with the <span class="ph pname">gamification service</span>.
			The demo application "Help Desk" follows this integration architecture:</p>

		<p class="p"><img class="image" id="loio84d9f86f384840ed975d39fadfb4a999__image_xl2_24h_3r" src="loioa9cdc60b132244eb83e6b899093ba892_HiRes.png"/></p>

		<p class="p">In a <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> setting we
			assume that the gamified app and the <span class="ph pname">gamification service</span>
			subscription are located in the same account. Furthermore, we assume that the
			application back end is written in Java, while the application front end is based on
			HTML5 or SAP UI5.</p>

		<p class="p">The technical endpoint is used to send gamification-relevant events and perform user management
			tasks from the application back end. Communication is based on a BASIC AUTH destination
			that uses the user name and password of a technical user.</p>

		<p class="p">The easiest way to show player achievements is to integrate a default user profile that comes
			with the <span class="ph pname">gamification service</span>
			subscription as an iFrame in the application's web front end.</p>

		<p class="p">To implement a user profile or single widgets (for example a progress bar tailored to the
			application's front end), we recommend you use the user endpoint in combination with a
			local proxy servlet and an app-to-app SSO destination. The proxy servlet prevents
			running into cross-site scripting issues and the app-to-app SSO destination
			automatically forwards the credentials of the authenticated user to the <span class="ph pname">gamification service</span>.
			This allows reuse of the access control mechanisms offered by the <span class="ph pname">gamification service</span>.</p>

		<p class="p">Since the user endpoint is used from a browser it is protected against cross-site request
			forgery. Accordingly, an XSRF token has to be acquired by the client first. </p>
