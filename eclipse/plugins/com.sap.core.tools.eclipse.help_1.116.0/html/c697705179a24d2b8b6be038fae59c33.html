				<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">master</span> and the redundant instance <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">shadow</span>.
			The shadow has to be installed and connected to its master. During the setup of high
			availability, the master pushes the whole configuration to the shadow. Later on, during
			a normal operation, the master also pushes configuration updates to the shadow, whenever
			the configuration is changed. Thus, the shadow instance is kept synchronized with the
			master instance. The shadow pings the master regularly, and if the master is not
			reachable for a while, the shadow tries to take over the master role and to establish
			the tunnel to <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>.<p class="p"/>

						host names, in order to use the host name under which the shadow host is
						visible to the master. As a last resort, you could even specify a host name
						manually, if the desired one is not available in the list. On first connect,
						you will be forced to log on to the master instance. The user and password
						of the master instance are required. Later on, the master and shadow
						instances exchange X.509 certificates, which will be used for mutual
								authentication.<p class="p"><img class="image" id="concept_p4y_fhj_q4__image_vd5_2sj_q4" src="loio5499f27db33b4d2996196ab19e370d67_HiRes.png"/></p>

					<li class="li">On successful connect, the master instance pushes the whole configuration
						and some information about itself to the shadow instance. This information

					<li class="li">As of version <kbd class="ph userinput">2.6.0</kbd>, in this <span class="ph uicontrol">High
							Availability</span> view on the master, at the bottom there is an
							<span class="ph uicontrol">Alert Messages</span> panel displaying alerts in case
						configuration changes had not been pushed successfully before. This could
						happen if a temporary network failure occurs just at the time a
						configuration change is done. Thus, an administrator can recognize whether
						there is an inconsistency in the configuration data between master and
						shadow that could cause trouble if the shadow needs to take over. Typically,
						the master recognizes this situation and tries to push the configuration
						change at a later time automatically. If this is successful, all failure
						alerts will be removed and replaced by a warning alert showing that there
						had been trouble before. As of version <kbd class="ph userinput">2.8.0.1</kbd> these
						alerts have been integrated in the general Alerting section so that the
						Alert Messages panel is no longer existing in the High Availability
							section.<p class="p">In case it does not recover automatically, disconnect/connect
							the shadow, which will trigger a complete configuration
						transfer.</p>
