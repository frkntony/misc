			<p class="p">The availability check is one per Java or SAP HANA XS application and is executed every
				minute. You can configure an availability check for an application either from the
				cockpit or from the console client. If your application is not available or its
				response time is too high, you will receive an e-mail notification. If you stop the
				application by yourself, you will not receive a notification as in this case
				alerting is suppressed and enabled once again when you start the application.
				However, this is not valid for productive SAP HANA databases as you cannot stop
				them. In this case, the availability check will start running at the moment you
				create it and will not stop until you delete it. E-mail alert is triggered if the
				application is not in state OK for two consecutive checks. There are five types of
				notifications: </p>

			<p class="p">You may also set your availability check for Java applications on account level using a
				relative URL. This means that each application started in your account will
				immediately receive an availability check requesting
					<span class="ph filepath">application_url/configured_relative_url</span>. This option is
				useful in case you start multiple instances of the same application (applications
				with the same relative health check URL) in your account and allows you to configure
				this check only once for all of them. You can configure availability checks on
				account level only from the console client. If there is a check configured on
				account level and a check configured on application level, the one on the
				application level has higher priority. For example, if you have in your account ten
				applications with the <span class="ph filepath">/health_check</span> relative URL and one
				multitenant application with the <span class="ph filepath">/myapp/health_check</span> relative
				URL, you can configure an availability check on account level for all applications
				and one availability check for the multitenant application to override the one on
				account level.</p>

			<p class="p">Availability monitoring in <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> is done by running HTTP GET
				requests against URL provided by the application operator. The http/https ping is
				not parsing the response body, but it is relying only on the HTTP response code. </p>

			<p class="p">Currently there are two limitations that need to be considered when designing your
				availability URL: </p>

			<ul class="ul" id="copy68f46b7fea21462b9c1c345b75524bec__ul_jsy_kjh_lj">
				<li class="li">The monitoring infrastructure does not support authorization for the checks. This means that
					you cannot pass user and password or client certificate when configuring the
					availability check. Therefore, you must design the availability URL without
					authentication or authorization. This will make sure that your application can
					be accessed in any case, the correct response code is returned (for example 200,
					404, 500 and so on) and the response time is only from your application. If your
					application responds with 302, the ping will follow the redirect.<div class="p">
						<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> If you design the availability URL as a protected resource, the check
							will consider 401 and 403 response codes as 200 OK. Note that these
							response codes may come from <span class="ph pname">Identity Authentication</span>
							and not from your application, in case of an authenticated
							application.</div>

					</div>
<p class="p">Currently, the response codes accepted by the 'http/https ping' are
							<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">200</span>, <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">302</span>,
							<span class="ph emphasis emphasis">401</span> and <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">403</span>. This is done to
						cover all the different types of URLs that can be monitored. You need to
						make sure that if something does not work as expected, your application is
						not returning some of the above 4 codes as you will not get an alert. </p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">The monitoring infrastructure supports only one availability check per Java or SAP HANA XS
					application. This means that if you have multiple web applications deployed
					together as one application in your account or application with multiple end
					points you want to check, you need to design one common availability URL to be
					able to monitor them all together. If one of the applications fails, you will
					get an alert and then you will have to check which one exactly is failing by
					opening the availability URL. <div class="note sap-recommendation recommendation" id="copy68f46b7fea21462b9c1c345b75524bec__sap-recommendation_N100DF_N100DC_N100AB_N10097_N10011_N10001"><span class="recommendationtitle">Recommendation</span> We
						recommend that the response is a simple, plain HTML, just stating which web
						application is OK and which is not. It depends on the implementation of the
						availability URL whether it will just inform that a web application is
						available or it will also check whether it is working as expected. If you
						plan to develop and operate multiple applications in your account, it is a
						good idea to have identical availability URLs for the different applications
						(for example /availability). This will allow you to configure the
						availability check only once on account level.</div>
</li>

			<p class="p">Sample output of application which is OK: </p>

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode">HTTP RETURN CODE 200 OK
Purchasing - OK

Sales - OK

Registration - OK

			<div class="div_pre_codeblock"><pre class="pre codeblock prettyprint nocode">HTTP RETURN CODE 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR

Sales - no connectivity to backend

Registration - OK

IDP - OK

</pre></div>

			<div class="note caution"><span class="cautiontitle">Caution</span> Note that the availability URL designed according to the above
				recommendations is unprotected and can be accessed by everyone. We recommend not
				putting sensitive information about your application there (for example error stack
				traces).</div>
