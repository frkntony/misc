			<p class="p">In order to setup a mutual authentication between the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span> and any
				back-end system it connects to, you can import an X.509 client certificate into the
					<span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>.
				The <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>
				will then use the so-called "system certificate" for all HTTPS requests to back-ends
				that request or require a client certificate. This means, that the CA, which signed
				the <span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>'s client certificate, needs to be trusted by all back-end systems to which the
					<span class="ph pname">Cloud connector</span>
				is supposed to connect. </p>

			<p class="p">This system certificate needs to be provided as PKCS#12 file containing the client
				certificate, the corresponding private key and the CA root certificate that signed
				the client certificate (plus potentially the certificates of any intermediate CAs,
				if the certificate chain is longer than 2). Via the file upload dialog, this PKCS#12
				file can be chosen from the file system, and its password also needs to be supplied
				for the import process. </p>

			<p class="p">As of version <span class="ph emphasis emphasis">2.6.0</span>, there is a second option - starting a
					<span class="keyword cmdname">Certificate Signing Request</span> procedure, similar to the UI
				certificate described in <a class="xref" href="b70bf164a6e6498b8bf1f459554609f5.html" title="By default, the Cloud connector comes with a self-signed default certificate, which is used to encrypt the communication between the browser-based user interface and the Cloud connector itself. For security reasons, however, you should replace this certificate with your own one so that the browser accepts the certificate without security warnings.">Exchanging UI Certificates in the Administration UI</a>. </p>

			<p class="p">If a system certificate has been imported successfully, its distinguished name, the name of
				the issuer, and the validity dates are displayed:</p>

			<p class="p">If a system certificate is no longer required it can be deleted. To do this, use the
				respective button and confirm deletion. If you need the public key for establishing
				trust with a server, you can simply export the full chain via the
					<span class="ph uicontrol">Export</span> button.</p>
