		in the HTTP destination.</p>

		<p class="p">To prevent that security-relevant headers or cookies are returned from the REST service to the client, only whitelisted headers are returned.
			While some headers are whitelisted per default, additional headers can be whitelisted in the application descriptor file. For more
			information about how to whitelist additional headers, see <a class="xref" href="df89d9cd06a84905a3a4747f102c5b2c.html" title="For security reasons not all HTTP headers are forwarded from the application to a backend or from the backend to the application.">Header Whitelisting</a>.</p>

		<p class="p">Cookies that are retrieved from a REST service response are stored by the HTML5 application in an HTTP session that is bound to the client
			request. The cookies are not returned to the client. If a subsequent request is initiated to the same REST service, the cookies are added
			to the request by the application. Only those cookies are added that are valid for the request in the sense of correct domain and
			expiration date. When the client session is terminated, all associated cookies are removed from the HTML5.</p>
