			<p class="p">To enable you to seamlessly integrate <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> applications with
				existing on-premise identity management infrastructures, <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>
				introduces single sign-on (SSO) and identity federation features. In <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>, identity information is provided by identity providers (IdP), and not
				stored on <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> itself. You can have a different IdP for each
				account you own, and this is configurable using the Cockpit. </p>

			<p class="p">The following graphic illustrates the high-level architecture of identity management
				in <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>.</p>

			<p class="p">If you don't have a corporate identity management infrastructure, you can use SAP ID
				Service. It is the default identity provider for <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>, and you

				credentials, without a separate user store and account in <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>.
				All information required by <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span> about the employee can be passed
