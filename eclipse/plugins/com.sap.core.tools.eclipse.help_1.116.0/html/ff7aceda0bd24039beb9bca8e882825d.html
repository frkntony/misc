		<p class="p"><span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span> supports the application
			cache buster concept for Java and ABAP servers and for <span class="ph pname">SAP Cloud Platform</span>. <span class="ph pname">SAP HANA</span> XS does

<p class="p">Applications provide an index file (created on the fly) containing the last modified
			timestamps of all included files (scripts, properties – files which we load via XHR
			programmatically). Technically this file is a mapping between the request path (below
			the context path of the application) and the last modified timestamp. </p>
<p class="p">The server in general caches all the above resources (not using the 304/not modified
			mechanism). For the index file we are using the 304/not modified mechanism to avoid to
			load when it has not been changed. </p>
<p class="p">On the client-side we initially load this file of the application when enabled via
			configuration option sap-ui-appcachebuster and use this for the XHR requests. If the
			request path is contained in the above mentioned index file we simply add the timestamp
			as leading path segment to this request. If the timestamp doesn’t change the URL is
			unique and therefore it will be taken from cache. Once the file is modified the URL
			parameter will be changed and therefore loaded again from the backend. </p>
<p class="p">The server has to delete the timestamp from this URL to lookup the file properly. For the Java
			applications <span class="ph"><span class="ph pname">SAPUI5</span></span>
			provides an AppCacheBusterFilter and for ABAP the logic is implemented in the ICF
			handler. Both backend implementations also generate the index file on-the-fly. </p>
